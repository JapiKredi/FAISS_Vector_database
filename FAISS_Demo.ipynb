This chapter covers key definitions and statis tical concepts that countries should use in \\nconstructing money, liquidity, credit,  and debt aggregates and sets  the stage for Chapter 7 which \\npresents the statistical framewor k for the compilation of monetary statistics in accordance with \\nthe methodology of this Manual . This chapter covers broad mone y in two sections, and dedicates \\none section to each of monetary base (also call ed base money or reserve money), liquidity, and \\ncredit and debt aggregates. \\n6.2. In general, this Manual  follows the concepts and principles of the 2008 SNA  with respect \\nto the sectoring of institutional units (as disc ussed in Chapter 3) a nd the classification of \\nfinancial assets (as discussed in Chapter 4)  which underlie and support the definitions and \\ncompilation of the aggregates covered in this chapter. The 2008 SNA  does not provide a specific \\nconcept or measure of broad money, although it c ontains several referen ces to broad money and \\nmonetary (money) aggregates. This Manual  provides a definition of broad money that was \\nabsent in the MFSM 2000 .  \\n6.3. In describing the money aggregates  covered in this chapter, the Manual  classifies \\nfinancial instruments on the liabilities side of th e sectoral balan ce sheets into included in or \\nexcluded from broad money, and groups instituti onal sectors/subsectors into money-issuing, \\nmoney-holding and money-neutral s ectors. These classifications are carried out to support the \\nthree basic dimensions of broad money which are (1) the financial instruments1 that are \\ncomponents of broad money; (2) the institutiona l sectors that are mone y issuers; and (3) the \\ninstitutional sectors that are either  money holders or money neutral.  \\n6.4. The definition of broad money in this Manual  is intended to help monetary statistics \\ncompilers determine the scope of broad money taking account of their own national circumstances. A precise covera ge of broad money, as well as monetary base, liquidity, and \\ncredit is determined in accordance with the structur e and other features of the financial system in \\nthe economy and against the benchmarks set in this chapter. The c overage of financial \\ninstruments included in broad money determines, in particular, which units in the financial \\ncorporations (FCs) sector are sector ed as depository corporations (DCs)\\n2 and constitute the \\nmoney issuing sector (subsector). \\n6.5. DCs are the only money issuers in some count ries; in other countries, broad money or \\nother money aggregates may include liabilities issued by institutional units outside the FCs \\nsector—in particular, by the cen tral government or public non financial corporations. When \\nmoney aggregates include liabilities issued by sect or(s) other than FCs sect or, these liabilities are \\ncombined with those included in the Depository Corporation Survey  (DCS)  which, as described \\nin Chapter 7, covers only the broa d money liabilities  issued by FCs. \\n                                                 \\n1 Within this chapter, the term “financial instrument” is used to relate to both assets and liabilities from the \\nperspective of their holders and issuers, respectively. Th e use of this term is for convenience only and does not \\nimply an extension of the coverage of assets and liabilities to include other financial instruments that are contingent \\nand are not financial claims, as described in Chapter 4. \\n2 See Chapter 3, paragraph 3.116.

              " Document(page_content=' 4 \\n \\n \\n A.   Basic Functions of Money \\n6.6. Money is recognized as having four  basic functions, serving as a: \\n\\uf0b7 medium of exchange —the means for settling a liabili ty, acquiring goods, services and \\nfinancial or non financial assets  without resorting to barter; \\n\\uf0b7 store of value  or purchasing power —a means of holding wealth; \\n\\uf0b7 unit of account —a standard for denominating the pri ces of goods and services and the \\nvalues of financial and nonfin ancial assets, thereby providing  a means for comparisons of \\nvalues and for preparation of financial accounts; and \\n\\uf0b7 standard of deferred payment —a means of relating current a nd future values in financial \\ncontracts. \\nB.   Rationale for Compiling a Money Aggregate \\n6.7. Money plays an important role in an economy and is a key component of the \\ntransmission mechanism from monetary policy to  economic activity and in flation. Conceptually, \\nthe notion of money has been linked to the form ulation of monetary po licy and the need for \\nmoney growth to be in line with  the desired real growth rate and level of inflation, given an \\nassumption on the velocity of money. Monetary gr owth can also impact on asset prices in an \\neconomy. Money aggregates measure the money available to money-holding sectors in the \\neconomy for making purchases of goods, services, nonfinancial asse ts and financial assets, and \\nare closely monitored by the central bank when de termining decisions that affect the short-term \\npolicy interest rate and/or the level of the monetary base. \\n6.8. In a number of countries, the change in the m oney aggregates is one of the intermediate \\nobjectives that facilitate the achievement of price stability (monetary target ing). In this type of \\nframework, a target is set every year for the de sirable level of change in a money aggregate \\nbased on the expected changes in GDP and the de sired price level. For economies applying other \\ntypes of monetary policy frameworks (such as in flation targeting and exch ange rate targeting), \\nmonitoring the changes in money aggregates contributes together with a series of \\nmacroeconomic variables, to the determination of  the policy actions to be taken by the central \\nbank.  \\nII. BROAD MONEY  \\nA.   Definition \\n6.9. Money, which takes the form of various types of financial instruments, is held for its \\nusability as a medium of exchange and a store of  value. In defining broad money, therefore, the \\nfocus is on these two char acteristics of money.  \\n6.10.  Broad money is the sum of all financial in struments held by money-holding sectors \\n(see paragraph 6.74) that are (1) me dium of exchange widely used  in an economy, or (2) close \\nsubstitutes for the medium of exchange that are reliable store of value. The latter includes ', metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Money_supply.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=' 5 \\n \\n \\n financial instruments that can be converted into the medium of exchange at short notice without \\nincurring a significant loss on the amount in itially invested by the current holder.  Financial \\ninstruments included in broad money must be both liquid and a reliable store of value, and, with \\na few possible exceptions, be issued by the money- issuing sector (DCs). Financial instruments \\nissued by other sectors, that are medium of ex change widely used in an economy or are close \\nsubstitutes for the medium of excha nge, can be included in broad money.  \\n6.11. Financial instruments that are widely used as a medium of exchange include currency \\n(coins and banknotes) as well as transferable deposits with DCs. Close substitutes for the \\nmedium of exchange include financial instrume nts which are liquid and are a reliable store of \\nvalue such as savings and term deposits, short- term debt securities, and non-transferable \\nshares/units in money market funds (MMFs).  \\n6.12. In an economy, media of exchange are norma lly denominated in the domestic currency. \\nFinancial instruments denominated in foreign currency can also se rve as a medium of exchange \\nin an economy if they are widely, or even offi cially, accepted as legal tender. In such cases, \\nfinancial instruments denominated in foreign cu rrency that meet the de finition of broad money \\n(currency, transferable deposits, and their close substitutes) are included in broad money. \\n6.13. An important consideration is the maturity of the financial instrument to be included in \\nbroad money. Typically one to two years at i ssuance is the maturity limit, although this Manual  \\ndoes not provide a strict limit. In some instances, maturity at issuance of possibly up to five years \\ncan arise for time deposits and debt securities. Maturity at issuance rather than remaining maturity is usually considered because the former  better reflects the in tention of money holders \\n(in the case of deposits) and the re liability as a store of value (in the case of debt securities).\\n3 \\n6.14. The definition of broad money should be a pplied based on domestic circumstances. The \\ninstrument coverage of broad money can be info rmed by an empirical approach that considers \\nthe relationship between broad money, and real a nd other financial variables. Running empirical \\ntests on different measures of br oad money may be helpful in d eciding where to draw the line, \\nfor example with reference to maturities of fina ncial instruments to be included in broad money. \\nCompilers should update these empirical test s as relationships can change over time. \\nB.   Financial Instruments Included in Broad Money \\n6.15. Broad money encompasses financial instrument s that are media of exchange or close \\nsubstitutes to media of ex change, all being liquid and a reliable store of value.  The combination \\nof these characteristics is described as the degree of moneyness.  In judging moneyness, account \\nis taken of the extent to which each  type of financial asset provides liquidity  and is a store of \\nvalue .  \\n6.16. Liquidity is an important characteristic of  financial assets included in broad money. A \\nfinancial asset is liquid if, at short notice and minimum cost, it can be bought, sold, or \\n                                                 \\n3 Long term debt securities are much less reliable as a store of  value, even is traded in secondary markets, because of \\ntheir fluctuations in value when interest rates change.

              " Document(page_content=' 6 \\n \\n \\n redeemed at, or close to, full value.  This means that to be liqui d, a financial asset must be \\nexchangeable against a medium of exchange with minimum co st and time, and without unduly \\naffecting the value of the asset. The liquidity of  a financial asset subsumes other more specific \\ncharacteristics such as negotiabi lity, transferability, marketabilit y, or convertibility, as well as \\ndivisibility.  \\n6.17. The most liquid financial assets  are currency and transferable  deposits which can be used \\nas a medium of exchange—that is, they are immediately excha ngeable on demand at par, to \\nacquire goods, services, and fina ncial (other than currency an d transferable deposits) or \\nnonfinancial assets. Financial asse ts other than currency and transferable deposits should possess \\nsignificant moneyness to be included in broad money. \\n6.18. By definition, all financial assets have value and, therefore, to varying degrees, are stores \\nof value. Financial instruments differ widely in how their nominal or real values are maintained \\nor fluctuate, in response to cha nges in prices and interest rate s in the economy. The extent to \\nwhich a financial instrument serves  as a reliable store of value depe nds on its capacity to increase \\nin nominal value or to maintain its real value ove r time. Financial assets that earn interest and \\ndividends are held because of this capacity. \\n6.19. In determining the components of broad m oney other than currency and transferable \\ndeposits, the following basic characteris tics need to be ta ken into account: \\n(a) Transactions costs . Deposits and some types of debt securities can be converted into \\ncurrency or transferable deposits without incu rring explicit costs in th e form of fees or \\nother charges or the implicit costs arising from delays in the conversion process. In \\ncontrast, conversion of some types of financial assets i nvolves substantial transaction \\ncosts or time delays. \\n(b) Divisibility . Differentiation by large and small denomi nation of a financial instrument is \\nconsidered both from the perspective of its inclusion or exclusion from broad money and \\nits position within the money hierarchy.   Financial instruments w ith large denominations \\nmay be excluded from broad money. Thres holds may vary in practice, depending on \\nnational circumstances. \\n(c) Maturity . Maturity is a major determinant of  the components of broad money as \\ndiscussed in paragraph 6.13. In some cases, th e hierarchy of a set of money aggregates \\nproceeds from only short-term components to the inclusion of longer-term deposits or \\ndebt securities in higher-ordered aggregates. \\n(d) Yield . In general, the compone nts added to form the progressively higher-ordered \\naggregates have higher yields than the inte rest-earning components of the lower-ordered \\naggregates. \\n6.20.

Currency and transferable deposits,  comprising the most liquid financial assets, meet \\nthe definition of broad money. Th e liquidity of currency and tran sferable deposits and their use \\nas a medium of exchange arises from the following underlying characteristics: \\n(a) Legal tender or general acceptability . Currency must be accepted for domestic \\ntransactions because of its st atus as legal tender; transf erable deposits are generally \\naccepted for transactions because of the recipien ts’ confidence in their acceptability as a \\nmedium of exchange. \\n(b) Fixed nominal (face) value . The nominal values of currency and non-interest-bearing \\ntransferable deposits are fixed, even though r eal values change with movements in the \\nprice level. \\n(c) Transferability . Currency and transferable deposits can be used to make direct third-party \\npayments. \\n(d) Transaction costs . Payment by currency has no fees or other transaction costs and the use \\nof transferable deposits has no fees or relatively small fees attached. \\n(e) Divisibility . Currency and transferable deposits are the most divisible financial assets \\navailable in denominations fo r making small transactions. \\n(f) Maturity . Currency and transferable deposits do not  have maturity and are immediately \\naccessible by their holders. \\n(g) Yield . Currency and transferable deposits earn no  or low interest because their usefulness \\nas a medium of exchange compensates the holde r for the forgone interest that could have \\nbeen received by holding othe r types of financial assets. \\n6.22. Domestic currency  consists of banknotes and coins as defined in Chapter 4 \\n(paragraph 4.21) issued by resident units that ar e used as a medium of exchange in an economy. \\nThe following concepts describe th e creation and use of currency: \\n(a) Issuance of currency . The incurrence of a liability fo r currency that is placed in \\ncirculation in the economy. The  currency issuer  is the institutional unit that records the \\ncurrency as a liability in its balance sheet. \\n(b) Placement of currency in circulation . Distribution (sale) of curr ency to holders outside \\nthe central bank (and any other issuing un it), including FCs, other sectors, and \\nnonresidents.

              " Document(page_content=' 9 \\n \\n \\n (c) Currency in circulation .4 The amount of currency outsid e the central bank (and any \\nother issuing unit) held by resident sectors and nonresidents. \\n6.23. Currency outside DCs  is the domestic currency incl uded in broad money and is \\ncompiled as currency in circulation less currency holdings in the vaults of ODCs.5 In the \\nmajority of economies, issuance of currency  is an exclusive right of the central bank, and \\nplacement of currency in circulation  is mainly or entirely channeled from the central bank \\nthrough the ODCs to the money-hol ding sectors of the economy. \\n6.24. The amount of currency placed into circulati on is determined by ODCs’ demand for vault \\ncurrency (cash in vault) and their customers’ demand for currency. Currency is placed into \\ncirculation when it is transporte d from the central bank to an ODC,6  accompanied by the \\nappropriate accounting entries.7 The currency becomes currency outside DCs  when ODCs’ \\ncustomers in the money-holding sectors exchange deposits for currency.8 \\n6.25. Commemorative  coins  are most often sold at prices we ll above the nominal  (face) value. \\nHowever, such coins can be produced in less expens ive form as well and sold at or near the face \\nvalue. These coins do not qualify as legal tender unless the central bank has a liability to redeem the commemorative coins. If the latter, the nom inal (face) value should be included in the \\ncurrency in circulation.\\n9 Otherwise, the central bank should classify the sale of the coins as a \\ntransaction in nonfinancial assets.10 \\n6.26. Difficulties arise in estimating the currency in circulation of the common currency in the \\nindividual member countries of a currency union. Currency issued in a currency union circulates \\nas legal tender throughout the union, making it difficu lt to estimate the amount of the currency \\nthat is in use in each member country. (See Annex 6.1.) \\n6.27. Transferable deposits  held by sectors that are designa ted as money holders are included \\nin broad money. Foreign-currency-denominated tr ansferable deposits held at domestic DCs that \\n                                                 \\n4 Currency in circulation  is the currency issued by the central bank an d is reported in the liability section of the \\nCentral Bank Survey (CBS)  (see Table 1S in Appendix II). \\n5 Currency outside DCs  is reported as a liability account in the  Depository Corpor ations Survey (DCS) .  \\n6 Central bank sometimes issues relatively small amounts in di rect transactions with institutional units in the money-\\nholding sectors. \\n7 The ODC records an increase in Currency—domestic  and a decrease in its transfer able deposit holdings at the \\ncentral bank. The central bank records the reduction in the ODC’s transferable deposits and an increase in currency \\nin circulation . \\n8 Upon demand from its customers, an ODC reduces its vault cash in exchange for a reduction in customers’ \\ntransferable (or savings) deposit holdings at the ODC. \\n9 The amount of currency being used as a medium of exchange is overstated by the nominal value of any coins and \\nbanknotes that have been withdrawn by collectors who value specific banknotes or coins for their age or rarity. The \\noverstatement is considered insignificant and is ignored when compiling broad money.  \\n10 Having acquired the coins from the mint, the central bank  records them at cost in nonfinancial assets in its \\naccounting balance sheet. Suppose the coin s are acquired at a cost of 10, an d are sold for 100 in exchange for \\ncurrency banknotes. The central bank would record a reduc tion in its currency liability of 100 (currency banknotes \\nreceived), a reduction in nonfinancial a ssets of 10 (commemorative coins out fr om inventory at cost), and a revenue \\nof 90 (profit from sale of coins). The coins thereby disappear from the balance sheet of the central bank. ', metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Money_supply.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",

Cashier’s checks, banker’s drafts , and similar liabilities issued by deposit-taking \\ncorporations at the reque st of a unit in a money-holding sector  are included in broad money (until \\ntheir redemption) within transferable deposits. \\n6.29. Traveler’s checks  issued by resident DCs and us ed predominantly for domestic \\ntransactions are deemed to meet the defin ition of broad money a nd are included within \\ntransferable deposits. If traveler ’s checks are expected to be used predominantly abroad, they \\nshould be excluded from broad money. The currenc y of issuance, may allow for a more refined \\nclassification as regards incl usion in broad money. Travele r’s checks issued in domestic \\ncurrency, depending on national circum stances, can be included in broad money and those issued \\nin foreign currency almost always  are excluded from broad money. \\n6.30. All types of  electronic money  as defined in Chapter 4 (paragraphs 4.30–4.33), issued by \\nresident DCs, that can be used  for direct third-party paymen ts are included in broad money \\nwithin transferable deposits.11    \\nOther Deposits \\n6.31. Other deposits, as defined in Chapter 4 (par agraph 4.39), issued by DCs account for the \\npredominant portion of broad money in many economies. \\n6.32. Non transferable savings deposits  and sight deposits  are redeemable at full value upon \\nrequest without penalty and fee, although restrictions may apply for requests for withdrawal at a \\nvery short notice if the holder intends to withdraw more than a certain amount. Savings deposits \\nare both liquid and a reliable store of value and, thus, are included in br oad money within other \\ndeposits. If equipped with automatic transfer service f eatures, savings deposits  are classified as \\ntransferable deposits and included in broad money. \\n6.33. Deposits redeemable at short notice  are included in broad money within other deposits if \\nthe period of prior notice is short. This Manual  does not recommend a specific limit for a “short” \\nperiod of prior notice; country practice s range between three to six months. \\n6.34. Early withdrawal of fixed-term deposits , especially of long-term maturity, usually \\ninvolves penalties, resulting in such deposits bein g less liquid. Fixed-term deposits of short-term \\noriginal maturity are included in broad money within other deposits; longer-term deposits are \\nexcluded. This Manual  does not recommend a part icular limit to the maturity for fixed-term \\ndeposits to be included in broad money, but cons iders a limit in the range of one to two years \\nacceptable (see also paragraph 6.13). \\n                                                 \\n11 The ODCs’ transactions with the reci pients of the electronic funds are similar to electronic settlements for other \\ntypes of transferable items.

Other deposits denominated in foreign currency  are viewed as having somewhat lower \\ndegree of moneyness, since their do mestic currency values are subj ect to change in response to \\nexchange rate movements. However, other depos its denominated in foreign currency that could \\nbe drawn upon at short notice to make third-party payments in the domestic economy are included in broad money. \\n6.36. Overnight and \\nshort-term repurchase agreements  that are liabilities of the money-issuing \\nsector are included in broad m oney within other deposits when held by a money-holding sector. \\nAll other repurchase agreements are classified  as loans (see Chapter 4, paragraphs 4.39j and \\n4.83–4.87). Repurchase agreements of over two y ears maturity are excluded; and national \\npractice may be to have a shorter maturity limit. \\nDeposits excluded from broad money \\n6.37. Restricted deposits  are defined in Chapter 4 (par agraphs 4.43–4.44). Withdrawals from \\nsome deposit accounts may be restricted only fo r short periods (up to one year), and such \\ndeposits may still possess sufficient moneyness to  be included in broad money. In general, \\ndeposits for which withdrawals are restricted for protracted periods of ove r one year are excluded \\nfrom broad money. \\n6.38. Import deposits  are deposits that import ers are required to place in special accounts as a \\nprerequisite to opening import le tters of credit. Balances on im port deposits are generally not \\navailable to their resident holde rs and are eventually  transferred to nonres ident exporters. Thus, \\nimport deposits are excluded from broad money. \\n6.39. Checks or other types of transf erable items are posted direc tly to depositors’ accounts, \\nbut these are unavailable for use until after the transferable items have been cleared through the \\ncentral bank or other clearing or ganization. Such unavailable deposits  should be recorded within \\nother deposits , but excluded from broad money. Exclusi on of such deposits from transferable \\ndeposits avoids their being double counted in broa d money, given that thes e deposits continue to \\nbe included in the transferable  deposits of DCs on which the items  were drawn until the items are \\ncollected from these corporations. \\n6.40. Restricted deposits in the form of compulsory savings deposits  are excluded from broad \\nmoney, unless withdrawal privileg es are such to make the depos its liquid. Foreign exchange \\ndeposits, such as under foreign exchange repatr iation schemes, for which withdrawals are not \\nallowed for protracted periods are excluded from broad money. \\n6.41. Other forms of restricted deposits are cu stodial deposits, escrow accounts, amounts in \\nconsignment for judiciary fine and penalty paym ents, good-faith deposits for participation in a \\nprivatization auction or for a placed bid. Such deposits are excluded from broad money for it is \\nimpossible to determine at inception how long they will be restricted. In th e event that the period \\nof restriction is known at incep tion, such deposits can be trea ted like fixed-term deposits. \\n6.42. Deposits with ODCs in liquidation  (see Chapter 3, paragraphs 3.133–3.135). A special \\nform of deposit restriction arises when an ODC is unable to meet depositors’ withdrawal \\ndemands for substantial periods, because the depo sit-taking corporation has insufficient funds or \\nbecause its operations have been suspended. In such cases, it is unclear how long depositors will ', metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Money_supply.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

In the meanti me, the deposits are illiquid. Nevertheless, as long \\nas the deposit-taking corporation co ntinues to exist, its liabilities to all depositors and other \\ncreditors also exist. This Manual  recommends exclusion of all deposit liabilities of ODCs in \\nliquidation from broad money. This applies to all deposits irrespective of whether they are \\ninsured by a deposit insurance scheme or uninsur ed. Reorganization, sale, or merger of the \\naffected deposit-taking corporations, or reim bursement by the deposit insurance scheme may \\nresult in all or part of the deposits ev entually becoming available to depositors. \\n6.43. In the process of restructur ing or liquidation, assets and liabilities of nonoperating ODCs \\nare frequently repackaged and auctioned or othe rwise transferred to other ODCs and emerge as \\nbalance-sheet items of the operating ODCs. Effort s should be made to ensure uninterrupted \\ncoverage of these assets and liabilities in the monetary st atistics througho ut the entire \\nrestructuring or liquidation process. \\n6.44. Nonoperating ODCs are intertwined in creditor /debtor relationships with other ODCs, \\nOFCs, and the central bank. Their reciprocal a sset/liability positions are netted out in the \\nconsolidation for compiling the ODCS and the DC S. In the absence of direct reporting by \\nnonoperating ODCs, data on their reciprocal asset/lia bility positions (and transactions, if any) \\nwith the central bank and operating FCs can be obtained from the accounts of the central bank \\nand operating FCs. \\n6.45. Each operating FC would be required to re port its positions with nonoperating FCs in a \\nformat that would enable the monetary sta tistics compilers to aggregate the data into \\nmemorandum items in the sectoral balance sheets of the central bank, ODCs, and OFCs.12 \\n6.46. Reserve deposits that nonoperating FCs hold at  the central bank may be restricted or \\nfrozen for a period. Excess reserves of these co rporations no longer are used to support credit \\nexpansion. Deposits held by the nonoperating FCs at the central bank should be excluded from \\nreserve deposits and thus from the monetary base. \\n6.47. Long-term saving schemes  held by households with the vi ew to constituting capital for \\nreal estate purchase, for an a dditional pension income after reti rement, or for financing college \\neducation for children can normally be redeemed, fu lly or partly, before maturity. Even if early \\nwithdrawals do not entail any loss on the amount initially invested, generally some form of \\npenalty occurs in the fo rm of a less favorable tax regime, for gone or lower interest or diminution \\nof financial advantages embedded in the sc heme under the provision that it reaches its \\ncontractual maturity. Thus, holders will consider early withdrawal only as a last resort because \\nthe initial intention has been not to use these amounts for some long time period. Consequently, \\nlong-term saving schemes are not  included in broad money. \\nMoney Market Funds’ Shares and Debt Securities \\n6.48. In some economies, MMF shares are close substitutes for transferable deposits because \\nthey can be used for direct third-party payments . In other economies, there may be restrictions on \\n                                                 \\n12 See memorandum items in the illustrative sectoral balance sheets/SRFs in Appendix II.

In all cases, MMF shares are redeemable  at a very short notice and are therefore highly \\nliquid and typically a reliable store of value. Thus, all MMF shares held by the money-holding \\nsectors are included in broad money.13   \\n6.49. Some types of short-term  debt securities (original matur ity) issued by DCs that can be \\nconverted into currency or tran sferable deposits at short notice  without incurring a significant \\nloss on the amount initially invest ed, meet the definition of broa d money. Such short-term debt \\nsecurities include negotiable ce rtificates of depos it and commercial paper issued by ODCs, and \\nare included in broad money when traded in efficient secondary markets.14 Bankers’ acceptances \\nare often transacted in inefficient specialized markets or have other limitations imposed on their \\nliquidity, warranting th eir exclusion from broad money. Su ch instruments could meet the \\ndefinition of broad money if traded in efficien t secondary markets. Short-term debt securities \\ndenominated in foreign currency traded in effici ent secondary markets may be included in broad \\nmoney. For the original maturity limit, this Manual  recommends applying the same limit as for \\nfixed-term deposits —that is a limit in the range of one to two years, depending on national \\ncircumstances (see paragraph 6.34). This Manual  recommends also that l ong-term debt securities \\nbe excluded from broad money, even if traded in  efficient secondary markets, because of their \\nprice uncertainty (fluctuations in value when the general level of interest rate changes). \\nFinancial Instruments Issued by Sectors Othe r Than Resident Depository Corporations \\nDomestic Currency Issued by Central Government \\n6.50. A central government may issue coins (and/or domestic banknotes) that  account for all or \\nonly part of the total domestic currency in an ec onomy. If this is the ca se, the central government \\nmost commonly issues the coins and the central bank issues the banknotes. \\n6.51. Though the central government incurs a liabil ity for issuance of currency, the central \\nbank often has sole responsibility for the pl acement of currency in circulation. A central \\ngovernment purchases the currency from a domestic or foreign mint (or bureau of engraving) and \\ndelivers the currency to the central bank. In the central bank’s accounts, the nominal (face) value \\nof the currency is recorded as vault cash ( Currency—Domestic ), along with a corresponding \\nincrease in the central bank’s liability ( Transferable deposits—In domestic currency ) to the \\ncentral government.15 \\n6.52. Issuance of this currency, although not a liability in the CBS or  DCS, enters the monetary \\nstatistics as a separate component  of broad money (see Box 6.1). In many cases, transactions data \\n                                                 \\n13 Deposits of MMFs held at ODCs are excluded from broad money (see paragraph 6.64) because MMFs are money \\nissuers. \\n14 Efficient secondary markets are compe titive markets characterized by easy acce ss for participants at relatively low \\ncost and typically produce frequent price quotations of traded instruments, such as provided by bid-offer spreads.  \\n15 Through this transaction, the central government obtains the seigniorage  from issuance of the currency—the net \\nrevenue equal to the difference between the nominal value of the currency and the cost of acquisition, distribution, \\nand maintenance of the currency.

When the central government places some of the currency into circulation through direct \\ntransactions with institutional uni ts in the money-holding sectors,16 the central government \\nshould provide monthly data on its total currenc y placed into circulation to compilers of \\nmonetary statistics.17 \\nForeign Currency \\n6.54. Foreign currencies can serve as store of value,  not only in the country  of issuance, but in \\nother countries. When a foreign currency is wide ly accepted as a medium of exchange within a \\ncountry, holdings of this foreign currency by resident units other than DCs and central \\ngovernment should be included in the currency co mponent of broad money. This is particularly \\nimportant for countries in which a foreign curre ncy is the main (or only) currency in use (See \\nAnnex 6.2). \\nDeposits Issued by Nonfinancial Corporations and Central Government \\n6.55. Public nonfinancial corporations  (for example, post office, and telecommunication \\nunits) in some countries accept transferable or  other deposits, mainly from households and, \\npossibly, from other sectors. The deposit taking se rvice is often provided for the convenience of \\nsmall savers, particularly those in rural areas th at are not served by ODC branches. As explained \\nin Chapter 3 (paragraph 3.128), if the financial activity of the public nonfinancial corporation,18 \\nsuch as the post office, has a separate set of acco unts (assets and liabilities), it is treated as a \\nseparate institutional unit include d in the ODCs subsector and its li abilities are included in broad \\nmoney. In those cases where financial and nonfinan cial activities are inte rtwined and a separate \\nset of accounts does not exist fo r financial activities, data co mpilation depends on the specific \\ncharacteristics and financial activities of  such public nonfinancial corporations: \\n(a) Deposit pass-through to a DC . In some countries, deposit taking constitutes the only \\nfinancial service provided by this kind of a public nonfinancial corporation. It maintains a \\ndeposit account at a DC (central bank or ODC ) into which all funds from the collected \\ndeposits are re-deposited. Either deposit liabilities of such a public nonfinancial \\ncorporation to its depositors or the deposit of  the public nonfinancial  corporation at the \\nDC are included in broad money, because th e inclusion of both would result in double-\\ncounting. Where sufficiently detailed informa tion is available on such public nonfinancial \\ncorporation and its depositors, the inclusion of the deposit liabilities of the nonfinancial \\n                                                 \\n16 For example, the central government could distribute the currency banknotes in making cash payments to \\nsuppliers of government goods and services. The central government might distribute coins to the household sector, \\nfor example, in the course of conducting cash transactions with individuals acquiring licenses or paying other \\ngovernment fees.  \\n17 The central government’s holdings of currency that has already been placed in  circulation—whether issued by the \\ncentral government or the central bank—should be excluded from broad money, if data are available to compilers. \\n18 In such cases, through their financial operations, the public nonfinancial corporations often engage in financial \\nintermediation, by taking deposits from small savers and lending to farmers and other small-loan customers.

The funds deposited with the nonfinancial corporation \\nmay be channeled directly to the ce ntral government for its use. This Manual  \\nrecommends that these deposits be included in broad money within other deposits. Data \\nmay be collected directly from the nonfinan cial corporation that operates the system. \\n6.56. The treasury or some other unit of the cen tral government may accept deposits or issue \\ndebt securities, such as treasur y bills and saving certificates th at meet the definition of broad \\nmoney. The proceeds from issuance of the deposits or debt securities may be used to finance central government expenses, or may be used for government lending directly  to other sectors of \\nthe economy. Only deposits and debt securities held by money-holding sectors are included in \\nbroad money. A limit in the range of original matu rity of one to two years is applied, depending \\non national circumstances. Data on deposits and debt securities may be obtained directly from \\nthe treasury or other relevant unit of the central government. For de bt securities, data could also \\nbe sourced from the centralized secu rities’ depositor y, if available. \\n6.57. In some countries, national regulations allow nonfinancial corporations  to issue traveler’s \\nchecks and electronic money, including mobile money, (see paragraphs 4.34–38)  as an ancillary \\nactivity, although most is suers are FCs. Traveler’s check s and electronic money issued by \\nnonfinancial corporations that meet the definiti on of broad money are included in broad money \\nwithin transferable deposits (issued by sectors other than DCs).\\n19 If traveler’s checks are used \\npredominantly abroad, they should be exclude d from broad money (see also paragraph 6.29). \\n6.58. Some types of (short-term)  commercial paper issued by nonfinancial corporations and \\ntraded in efficient secondary markets may be co nverted into the medium of exchange at short \\nnotice without incurring a significa nt loss on the amount initially i nvested by the current holder, \\nand thus may be considered close substitutes for the medium of exchange. Consequently, such commercial papers of original maturity in the range of one to two years, depending on national \\ncircumstances, and held by mone y-holding sectors can be included in broad money. Data on such \\ncommercial papers outstanding may be obtained from exchanges where they are traded or \\ndirectly from the issuer, if available. \\nFinancial Instruments Excluded from Broad Money \\n6.59. The other categories of financial instruments— loans; equity and investment fund shares \\n(except money market fund shares) ; financial derivatives and employee stock options; insurance, \\npension and standardized guarantee schemes; and other accounts payable/receivable —are \\nexcluded from broad money. \\n6.60. The direct and specific nature of the financ ial contract between lenders and borrowers \\nmakes many types of loans  illiquid. As observed above, some s ecurities repurchase agreements \\n                                                \\n \\n19 Conceptually, if the payment services become the major activity of a nonfinancial corporation, it should be \\nconsidered for reclassification as an FC.

Other \\nrepurchase agreements are classified as loans. \\n6.61. Equity and investment fund shares serve as a store of value a nd may be converted to cash \\nor transferable deposits through their sale in organized secur ities exchanges or over-the-counter \\nmarkets. These instruments experience price vari ability and the sale of  such shares involves \\ntransaction costs and time dela ys, resulting in their exclusion from broad money. Shares in \\nMMFs are an exception, as explained in paragraph 6.48. \\n6.62. Insurance, pension and standardized guarantee schemes are illiquid and are excluded \\nfrom broad money. Financial derivatives  may be tradable, but their pr ice variability and lack of \\nuse as a store of value precludes their inclusion in broad money. Other accounts \\nreceivable/payable  lack sufficient liquidity to be included in broad money. \\nC.   Money-Issuing, Money Neutral, and Money-Holding Sectors \\n6.63. The compilation of money aggregates and count erparts requires the cl assification of all \\ninstitutional sectors/subsectors as defined in Chapter 3 into three gr oups as money issuers, \\nmoney neutral, or money holders in the broad money framework within the DCS. \\nMoney-Issuing Sector \\n6.64. The framework for monetary statistics classifi es all FCs that issue broad money liabilities \\nas DCs and recommends the compilation of a DC S showing, in a balance sheet format, broad \\nmoney liabilities of the DCs on one side and the asset counterparts (or sources) of those \\nliabilities on the other side. Thus, the DCs sector constitutes the money-issuing sector by \\ndefinition. \\n6.65. When some broad money liabilities  are issued by institutional units other than FCs, it is \\nnecessary to combine these liabilities with thos e included in the DCS in order to compile the \\ntotal broad money of the economy. Box 6.1 provi des a framework for such a presentation. \\n6.66. Many countries compile two or more money ag gregates that have progressively broader \\ncoverage (see Box 6.2). In such cases, the mone y-issuing sectors may differ across these money \\naggregates. As regards broad money issued by DCs, a single aggregate as defined in \\nparagraph 6.10 must be specified in order to construct the DCS  described in Chapter 7. \\nMoney Neutral Sectors \\n6.67. Nonresidents’  deposit holdings are, in principl e, excluded from broad money, because \\ntheir deposits are used primarily for international rather than domestic transactions. The potential \\nimpact on domestic economic conditions is uncer tain as the predomin ant center of economic \\ninterest of the nonres ident lies outside of  the domestic economy. \\n6.68. Deposits held by migrant workers (see pa ragraphs 3.83–85 for their sectoring) with \\nODCs in their home countries which are freely us able by authorized family members or other \\ndesignated parties in settling transactions in the home country should be included in broad \\nmoney of the home country and not in liabilities to nonresidents.

              " Document(page_content=' 17 \\n \\n \\n 6.69. Deposits held by cross-border workers at ODCs in an economy where they work (see \\nparagraphs 3.56–3.57) should not be included in broad money of th e economy where they work, \\nbut should be recorded as liabilities to nonresid ents. This principle applies as long as cross-\\nborder workers do not have a center of predom inant economic interest in the economy where \\nthey work, as discussed in paragraph 3.57. \\n6.70. Deposit holdings of central government  are always excluded from broad money. The \\nrationale, often empirically based, for such excl usion is that central government deposit holdings \\ndo not respond to macroeconomic influences (i.e ., changes in economic ac tivity, interest rates, \\nexchange rates, etc.) in the same way, or to the same degree, as deposits of the money-holding \\nsectors. This is because of the unique nature of  the central government’s financing constraints, \\nspending decisions, and cash mana gement techniques. The balances maintained by the central \\ngovernment with DCs do not reflect the short term intention of spending because central \\ngovernment’s spending is not predetermined and c onstrained by such balances. Further, inflows \\nexceeding current needs for cash may be used to re duce indebtedness, rather than meet expenses. \\nVice-versa, insufficient tax and other revenue  inflows may be supplemented by borrowing at \\nshort notice. \\n6.71. Exclusion of central government deposits from  broad money can also be explained on the \\nbasis of the analytical approach  to monetary and fiscal policy formulation. A major element of \\nsuch formulation focuses on the amount of cen tral government financ ing that DCs provide, \\nrepresented by the net claims on the central government—that is , total claims on the central \\ngovernment less the central government’s deposits and othe r liabilities to the central government. \\nThe DCS, described in Chapter 7, shows net claims  on the central government  as a counterpart to \\nbroad money, instead of including central govern ment deposits as a component of broad money \\nor as a separate liability categ ory. The link between broad money and the other accounts of the \\nDCs, including net claims on central gove rnment, is described in Chapter 7. \\n6.72. These two sectors—central government and nonresidents—that neither are “money \\nissuers” (except special cases) nor “money ho lders” are called “mon ey neutral” sectors. \\n6.73. Domestic currency holdings of  the central government and no nresidents, in principle, \\nshould be excluded from broad money; efforts to estimate such holdings may not be justified if \\nthe amounts are relatively small. Estimation of nonresidents’ holdings of the domestic currency, \\nand adjustment of broad money to exclude such  holdings, may be warranted if a substantial \\namount of domestic currency circulates outside the domestic economy and is used as legal tender \\nin one or more other countries.20  \\n                                                 \\n20 For most countries, the major cross-bo rder currency flows arise from the currency holdings  of tourists, business \\ntravelers, cross-border workers, emigrant workers returning to their home countries, and those engaged in smuggling \\nor other illegal activities. For those countries that use foreign currency as a legal tender, official shipments of foreign currency may be used to augment the cu rrency stock. The records for such sh ipments can be used to estimate the \\ncurrency stocks in both countries (i.e., the “importing” and “exporting” countries).

              " Document(page_content=' 18 \\n \\n \\n Money-Holding Sectors \\n6.74. Money holders are all sectors not discussed, that is: (i) nonfinan cial corporations; \\n(ii) OFCs; (iii) state and loca l governments; (iv) households; and (v) non-profit institutions \\nserving households.  Broad money includes all money holdi ngs of these sectors. Thus, broad \\nmoney represents a particular measurement of the capacity of spending or potential purchasing \\npower of money-holding sectors. \\nSpecial Cases \\n6.75. The grouping of all institutional sectors in to money-issuing, money-holding, and money \\nneutral sectors is one of the dimensions for de fining broad money liabilities in the DCS. The \\ncoverage of the DC sector should be kept unde r continued review as the financial system \\nevolves. In this respect, there ar e several exceptions as noted above: \\n(a) money can be issued by money neutral sect ors, such as central government/treasury \\nissuing coins, treasury accepting deposits from money holders, and foreign currency issued by a nonresident cen tral bank circulating widely in an economy; \\n(b) money can be issued by money-holding sect ors, such as post office accepting deposits \\nfrom money holders and nonfinancial corporatio ns issuing travelers ch ecks or electronic \\nmoney as an ancillary activity; and \\n(c) holdings of domestic currency by nonresiden ts and by central government may not be \\nexcluded from broad money measurement because of a lack of reliable source data. \\n6.76. The balances maintained by DCs in currency, in transferable and other deposits, and in \\nother financial assets with other resident DCs th at would otherwise meet the definition of money \\nare not included in broad money as intra-DC positions are consolidated out in the DCS, as \\nexplained in Chapter 7. The holdings of these as sets by DCs do not repres ent their short term \\nintention of spending but rather are determin ed by (i) regulations en acted by monetary and \\nregulatory authorities, and (ii) the need for ma intaining working balances in liquid financial \\nassets to be able to satisfy po ssible requests of such assets from  their clients. Hence, DCs are \\nmoney issuers (see above), but not money holders. \\n6.77. A few types of OFCs are mainly engaged in providing intermediation services to banks, \\neffectively creating transactions similar to inter-bank business. Central clearing counterparties (CCPs) are one example. CCPs ar e classified as OFCs and, cons equently, are likely to hold \\nmoney at deposit-taking corporations . The deposit balances of CCPs reflect their principal line of \\nbusiness of settling transactions am ong financial market participants  rather than the intention of \\nmaking purchases within the economy. Thus , deposits of CCPs at re sident deposit-taking \\ncorporations related to their principal line of business  should not be included in broad money. To \\nthis end, direct collection of data from CCPs on their deposit balances ma y be necessary if DCs \\ndo not identify CCP deposit balances in the report  forms used for the compilation of monetary \\nstatistics. If feasible, data directly collected from CCPs on their deposit ba lances should be split \\nbetween the amount related to their principal li ne of business and the amount maintained for \\noperating expenses; if available, the la tter should be included in broad money.

This Manual  distinguishes two levels of br oad money as shown in Box 6.1: \\n(a) broad money issued by DCs only; and \\n(b) broad money issued by DCs and other sectors. \\n6.79. Further, although this Manual  recommends compilers to focus on the broad money \\naggregate,21 it recognizes that economies may define a range of money a ggregates that are \\nusually named in a sequence as follows: M1, M2, M3, etc., with each broader aggregate \\nsubsuming the previous one. \\n6.80.  Whereas for almost all countries, M1 is the narrowest money aggregate and includes \\nusually all media of exchange (currency and transferable depos its in domestic currency), the \\ncontent of the other aggregates  M2, M3, etc. may differ signifi cantly in concept and coverage \\nacross economies. The higher-ranked M aggregat e usually corresponds to broad money for each \\neconomy. Box 6.2 presents examples of national a ggregates of broad money and draws out some \\ncommon characteristics using the three dimensions of broad mone y: financial assets (including \\nmaturity and domestic/foreign currency) , money issuers, and money holders. \\n                                                 \\n21 Compilers sometimes still use the term “quasi-money” because of the focus on “narrow money” in the past. Under \\nthis approach, “narrow money” corres ponded to the media of exchange only which was then considered “money.” \\nConsequently, “quasi-money” included all financial instruments that were not media of exchange, but were \\nsubstitutes to them. This Manual  recommends not using the term “quasi-money”, but rather focusing on broad \\nmoney because it covers all financial instruments that constitute money, including those formerly included in \\n“quasi-money.” ', metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Money_supply.pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",

Broad Money Counterparts or Sources \\n6.81. Understanding changes in broad money and their causes is important for the conduct of \\nmonetary policy. The money aggregat es, therefore, need to remain  relevant to monetary policy \\nanalysis, particularly as financial institutions and markets evolve. As explained above in this \\nchapter, broad money is compiled using data from the sectoral balance sheets of the central bank \\nand ODCs.  \\n6.82. First, monetary statistics compilers identify on the liability side of DCs’ sectoral balance \\nsheets all financial instruments meeting the de finition of broad money and assemble them \\ntogether on one side of the DCS. \\n6.83. Second, all assets held by DCs and all liabil ities that are not part  of broad money are \\nassembled on the other side of the DCS, which ar e considered as broad money “counterparts” or \\n“sources.” For the broad money counterparts, cl aims on and liabilities to non-money holder \\nsectors (namely, nonresidents, central governme nt, and DCs) are presented on a net basis \\n(i.e., assets less liabilities). As regards money-holdi ng sectors, the broa d money counterparts \\ninclude gross claims of DCs on mo ney holders as well as their liab ilities to money holders that \\nare not included in broad money. Broad m oney counterparts provide information on the \\nunderlying sources of broad money growth such as credit growth to resident units other than \\nDCs. \\n6.84. Chapter 7 presents in detail the structure of the DCS and the counterparts to broad \\nmoney. The term broad money “counterparts” refers  to the accounting iden tity between the two \\nsides of the DCS (stock positions) while the term  broad money “sources” refers to the factors \\naffecting the expansion and c ontraction of money (flows). \", metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Money_supply.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=' 24 \\n \\n \\n 6.85. Table 6.1 presents a summary DCS, highligh ting broad money and its counterparts or \\nsources. In the table, sub-components of counter parts carrying minus si gn originate from the \\nliabilities side of the sectoral balance sheets. \\nTable 6.1.

When broad money includes liabilities issued by institutional units other than FCs, the \\ncompilation of counterparts of broad money becomes less strai ghtforward, unless sufficiently \\ndetailed balance sheets of these money issuers ar e available to the monetary statistics compilers. \\nIn addition, as issuance of broad money accounts for a marginal part of the balance sheet of these \\nunits and the structure of the bala nce sheet is quite diffe rent from that of DCs, the inclusion of \\ntheir broad money counterparts ma y distort the analysis of the factors affecting the expansion \\nand contraction of broad money. For example, th e large proportion of nonf inancial assets and \\nindebtedness to residents other than broad mone y liabilities (exceeding by far their claims on \\nresidents) in their balance sheets will result in  the significant reduction of  financial counterparts \\nto broad money. \\n6.87. Consequently, this Manual  recommends compiling counterpa rts of broad money within \\nthe perimeter of the DCS and not for other meas ures of broad money th at include instruments \\nissued by institutional units other than FCs.  Countries may, however, elect to compile \\ncounterparts for the added components of broad money issued by units other than FCs. Two \\napproaches may be used: \\n(a) A single contra-entry is recorded for the full amount of the added components. For \\ninstance, the contra-entry for currency/de posits/debt securities issued by central \\ngovernment is recorded under Net claims on central government  and the contra-entry for \\n                                                 \\n24 “Other resident sectors” include all resident sectors that are money holders, namely OFCs, nonfinancial \\ncorporations, government units other than central government, households and NPISH.

MONETARY BASE \\n6.91. The monetary base25 comprises central bank liabilities that support the expansion of \\ncredit and broad money. The monetary base is also called high-powered money , because changes \\nin the monetary base support larger increases in credit and money through the money multiplier. \\nThe money multiplier indicates the maximum  amount of additional broad money that deposit-\\ntaking corporations can create by a unit of central bank money.26 The issuance (or creation) of \\nadditional broad money by deposit-taking corpora tions is mainly achieved through the direct \\nextension of loans to money-holding sectors, but  can also be achieved through the purchase of \\nassets not included in broad money. \\n6.92. The monetary base is a measure of the fundi ng base that underlies the money aggregates, \\nrather than a money aggregate. The monetary base includes at least two components that are \\nexcluded from broad money: (1) ODCs’ holdi ngs of deposits with the central bank, and \\n(2) ODCs’ holdings of domestic currency. \\n6.93. The monetary base is calculated exclusively from the liability side of the central bank \\nbalance sheet. Thus, the central bank is the sole issuer of th e monetary base. Other resident \\nsectors, particularly ODCs, are monetary base holders. As in the case for broad money, central \\ngovernment and nonresidents are not monetary base -holders (i.e., central bank liabilities to these \\nsectors are excluded from the monetary base, with  the exception of their holdings of domestic \\ncurrency, because of a lack of reliable sour ce data (see also paragraphs 6.73 and 6.75c)). \\n6.94. The monetary base is defined as currency in circulation outside the central bank, \\nODCs’ deposit holdings at the central bank, an d those deposits of money holding-sectors27 at \\nthe central bank that are also  included in broad money.  Compilers may include additional \\ncomponents in the monetary base, depending on the types of liabilities issued by the central bank \\nand the analytical use for which the monetary ba se is formulated (see Box 6.3 for representative \\ncomponents of monetary base). \\n                                                 \\n25 Different terms are used for “monetary base,” such as re serve money, base money, and central bank money. This \\nManual  recommends using the term “monetary base.” \\n26 Arithmetically, the maximum level of the money multiplier is simply the reciprocal of the compulsory reserve \\nrequirement ratio set by the central bank on deposits collect ed by the deposit-taking corporations. If the reserve ratio \\nis r (with 0 < r ≤ 1) uniformly, the money multiplier is 1/r. For example, if r = 0.05 (5 percent), 1/r = 20 and the \\nmaximum amount of additional broad money that deposit-ta king corporations can issue is “excess reserves” × 20. \\nThe general formula of the multiplier incorporates additional parameters, including the public’s preference for \\ncurrency (currency in circulation).  \\n27 As defined earlier in this chapter, money-holding sect ors are OFCs, state and local governments, nonfinancial \\ncorporations, and households and nonprofit institutions serv ing households. In the few cases where households have \\ndeposits with the central bank, these are usually depo sits of the central bank current and former staff.

Deposits in foreign currencies, if any, to sa tisfy reserve requirements, and for clearing \\nand external payments purposes ar e also included in the monetary base.  In some countries, \\nODCs collect deposits in foreign cu rrencies from their clients and are required to redeposit all or \\npart of these funds at the central bank.

A special case arises when central banks  sell securities to ODCs under repurchase \\nagreements. For the central bank, th e transaction is recorded as a liability to ODCs, accompanied \\nby a reduction in ODC deposits within the moneta ry base. Inclusion or exclusion from the \\nmonetary base of such liabilities to ODCs will depend on the central banks’ objective in \\nengaging in the securities repurchase.

The concept of liquidity is de fined and used in several differe nt ways in various contexts. \\nThis Manual defines the concept of liquidity an d liquidity aggregates from the perspective of \\nissuers of financial liabilities included in measures of liquidity. Liquidity aggregates are \\ndefined as the sum of broad money liabilities and other liabilities that ar e somewhat liquid but \\nnot included in broad money.  Liquidity aggregates have the same three underlying dimensions \\nas broad money: (1) financial instruments—com ponents of liquidity aggr egates, (2) liquidity-\\nissuing sectors, and (3) liquidity-holding sector s. This section presen ts a non-prescriptive \\nframework on how liquidity aggregates are compile d and what financial instruments are included \\nin liquidity aggregates (Box 6.5). \\n6.102.   Recent developments, including the 2007–2009 gl obal crisis, demonstrated once again \\nthat broad money may not capture the full ra nge of liquidity-creating mechanisms and \\ninstruments, given the increasing importance of OFCs and the substitution of different financial \\ninstruments issued by ODCs and other issuers. Liquidity aggregates provide a broader measure \\nof the available liquidity in the economy than  broad money, encompassing liabilities issued by \\nODCs, OFCs, and other issuers of financial instruments. \\n6.103.  In recognition of the scope for substitution of financial instruments, liquidity aggregates \\nare broader than broad money with respect to both the types of financ ial instruments and the \\nissuing sectors covered. Liquidi ty aggregates include, in add ition to broad money liabilities, \\nother liabilities that are also somewhat liquid, but that do not m eet the definition of broad money. \\nBox 6.5 illustrates the types of liabilities and holding and issu ing sectors that would be \\nconsidered in constructing liqui dity aggregates. All resident sectors, except households and \\nNPISH, are liquidity issuers; all resident sect ors are liquidity holders except DCs and central \\ngovernment.  \\n ', metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Money_supply.pdf', 'page': 29}),\n",

One significant difference between financia l instruments included in broad money and \\nthe additional instruments included in liquidity aggregates is maturity. Liquidity aggregates \\ninclude financial instrume nts with longer original maturities than those in broad money. A longer \\nduration for tradable debt instruments entails a higher exposure to changes in the yield curves \\nand, consequently, an increased sensitivity of thei r market value to changes in market interest \\nrates. Their market value may, therefore, fall sign ificantly below the amount initially invested by \\nthe current holder. \\n6.105.  Box 6.6 presents an example of  measures of liquidity aggr egates. Liquidity aggregates \\ncompiled by a number of countries are diverse. In many cases countries compile two or three \\nliquidity aggregates. For instance,  a liquidity aggregate L1 coul d include broad money plus long-\\nterm deposits and long-term saving schemes; L2 could further cover long -term debt securities \\nissued by ODCs, debt securities issued by government units and OFCs, and non-MMF \\ninvestment fund shares; L3 could further co ver debt securities i ssued by nonfinancial \\ncorporations; and L4 could furt her cover shares of nonfinancial  corporations, and financial \\ninstruments issued by nonresiden ts. Investment fund shares not included in broad money would \\nbe included in the appropriate liquidity measure based on the types of financial assets that the \\nfund invests in. \\n6.106.  The main focus of monetary statistics comp ilers are liquidity aggregates issued by the \\nentire FCs sector that can be  derived from the FCs survey (FCS) discussed in Chapter 7. \\nLiquidity aggregates issued by FCs may be grouped in different ways, including into core \\nliabilities  (i.e., those liabilities of DCs in cluded in broad money) and noncore liabilities  (all other \\nliabilities of FCs included in liquidity aggregates).28 \\nBox 6.6.

Credit creation involves the provision of resources by one institutional unit (the \\ncreditor or lender) to another unit (the debtor  or borrower). The creditor acquires a financial \\nclaim, and the debtor incurs a liability to repay. Credit is viewed from the asset side, and debt \\nfrom the liability side. \\n6.108.  Debt instruments are defined in the BPM6 , as well as the Public Sector Debt Statistics: \\nGuide for Compilers and Users and the External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users \\n2013. The 2008 SNA  provides general definiti ons for credit and debt. \\n6.109.  This Manual  uses the term claims on to refer to the financial assets held by one unit that \\nare liabilities of another unit,  and recommends the measurement of such claims within the \\nframework of the surveys, as presented in Chapte r 7, and the stock and flow data for the entire \\neconomy, as presented in Chapter 8. The fo llowing sections provide guidance for the \\ncompilation of credit and debt aggregates. \\nB.   Credit \\nIntroduction \\n6.110.  Measures of credit have the same three dimensions as broad money. Compiling credit \\nmeasures involves specifying: (1) the financial assets in cluded; (2) the issuing sectors (lenders); \\nand (3) the holding sectors (borrowers). Measures  of credit may encompass the total economy or \\nmay be limited to specific issuing sectors (e.g., credit issued by DCs). Credit measures may also \\nfocus on specific lender/borrower relationships (e.g., central bank credit to  central government). \\nThe composition and coverage of credit measures s hould be reviewed periodi cally to ensure that \\nthey reflect the changing use and type of credit instruments and new credit channels such as a \\ngreater reliance on securities markets (see Box 6.7) , as well as the impact of securitization on the \\nmeasurement of ODCs’ credit to the money-holding sectors. \\n6.111.  Credit is a major link in the money transmissi on process. Credit to nonfinancial sectors \\nfinances production, consumption, and capital form ation. Credit expansion historically has been \\naccompanied by an expansion of broad money. This relationship can be seen in Tables 6.1 and 6.2 on broad money and its counterp arts. Broad credit aggregates are related to overall economic \\nactivity; data on specific types of credit (e.g., mort gage lending, consumer credit, or construction \\nlending) are related to the economic activity of sp ecific sectors or industries. \\n6.112.  Credit measures cover financial assets and therefore exclude contingent positions such as \\nlines of credit, loan commitments, and guarant ees. However, the compilation of supplementary \\ninformation on such contingent positions may be  of value in projecting credit expansion and \\nassessing credit condit ions. Credit intermediation may o ccur through different channels. \\nFinancial assets \\n6.113.  Credit measures may cover all or only a subset of financial assets that constitute forms of \\ncredit. Narrow credit measures cover claims in the fo rm of loans, debt secu rities, and trade credit ', metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Money_supply.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=' 34 \\n \\n \\n and advances. Such measures exclude deposits, e quity, and other accounts r eceivable (other than \\ntrade credit). Even though the plac ing of deposits is not considered  a typical method of providing \\ncredit, there are circumstances in which such deposits are viewed as a credit extension—for \\nexample, when government units maintain depos its in FCs for the express purpose of funding \\nspecific activities of these corporations. In such ca ses, the financial assets have the legal form of \\na deposit but have the economic nature of a loa n. Financial derivatives, and claims on insurance \\ncorporations and pension funds are al ways excluded from credit measures. \\n6.114.  Broader credit measures encompass most types of financial claims of one unit on another \\nand may include holdings of equ ity. Acquisition of equity provi des financial resources and a \\nclaim on the issuer in a manner similar to othe r credit extensions, but its nature differs \\nsubstantially from other credit flows from debt  instruments. Institutional, fiscal, and market \\nconditions may affect preferences to  use either debt securities or  equity instruments as primary \\nmeans of investing in corporations , and these patterns are reflected in the financial assets to be \\nincluded in credit measures. \\n6.115.  Credit aggregates can separately identify financial assets denominated in foreign \\ncurrencies and breakdowns by original maturity. They may also be disaggregated by type of \\ncredit instrument, by sector of the lende r and borrower, and by purpose of lending. \\nLenders \\n6.116.  The lending sectors may be defined narrowly or broadly. Narrow credit aggregates may \\nbe defined to include only DCs’ claims on ot her sectors. The DCS presented in Chapter 7 \\nprovides the statistical framewor k for developing credit measur es for DCs’ financial claims. \\nBroader measures may cover all FCs’ claims, as included in the FCS described in Chapter 7, as \\nwell as claims of all domestic sect ors and nonresidents. (See Box 6.7.) \\n6.117.  Suppliers of credit w ithin the FCs sector are a broade r group than the issuers of broad \\nmoney liabilities. OFCs may provide credit using th e same or similar credit instruments as DCs, \\nthereby differing from them only with respect to  the manner in which their funding is acquired \\nand the types of noncredit services provided. Thes e other credit suppliers (OFCs) obtain funds by \\nincurring liabilities that are not included in br oad money, such as through  the issuance of long-\\nterm debt securities, borrowing from DCs or issuance of equity. \\n6.118.  Government units may provide credit to fi nancial and nonfinancial corporations, and \\ncredit measures broadly defi ned should cover government lending. Government units (and \\ncentral banks) may obtain financing from abro ad for specific domestic uses. The government \\nmay incur a direct liability to the nonresident sour ce of funds or may act as an agent or guarantor \\nbetween the nonresident creditor and the final recipient of the credit. When the government \\nincurs a direct liability and on-lends the funds, th ese transactions should be recorded as foreign \\nliabilities of the government a nd as credit provided by the governm ent to the final recipient. \\nWhen the government acts only as an agent or gu arantor between the nonresident and the final \\nrecipient, the nonresident should be  shown as providing the credit dire ctly to the fi nal recipient. \\n6.119.  A similar situation may arise when government  units (or central ba nks) provide funds to \\nFCs to finance specific types of credit (e.g., credit to ag riculture or to other specific industries). If \\nthe financial corporation incurs a direct liability to the govern ment and acquires a claim on the ', metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Money_supply.pdf', 'page': 33}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=' 35 \\n \\n \\n final recipient, the credit should be recorded as credit provided by the government to the \\nfinancial corporation and as cred it extended by the financial corpor ation to the final recipient. \\nWhen the financial corporation acts only as an agent for the government, credit should be shown \\nas being provided by the government directly to the final recipient. \\n6.120.  Some important types of cred it are provided primarily by nonfinancial sectors. Trade \\ncredit supplied by nonfinancial corporations is an example. Nonfinancial units often acquire \\nfinancial assets for liquidity purpos es and, as a result, are signifi cant suppliers of credit to other \\nunits. Many nonfinancial corporations provide cred it to affiliated companies, and governments \\nmay also be suppliers of credit to public financ ial or nonfinancial corpor ations and to private \\ncorporations operating in specific sectors of the economy targeted by the government. \\n6.121.  Resident units can also acquire  credit from nonresidents, pa rticularly from foreign FCs \\nand international financial institutions. As fina ncial liberalization procee ds, residents, including \\nDCs, can borrow from nonresident FCs. Inter-bank borrowing from foreign DCs can be an important source of finance, particularly during a period of fast credit expansion in the domestic \\neconomy and can be usefully recorded separate ly within foreign liabilities in the DCS. \\nBorrowers \\n6.122.  Under broad definitions of credit for an economy, the borrowing sectors are usually \\ndefined to include all nonfinanci al sectors. Specific credit measures may focus on credit provided \\nto individual sectors or subsector s or groupings of sectors. Comm on examples include credit to \\ncentral government, credit to th e total or nonfinancial public sector, credit to nonfinancial \\ncorporations, credit to the nonfinancial private se ctor, and credit to the ho usehold sector. Data on \\ncredit to nonresidents are needed to account for total credit provided, but analysis often focuses \\non claims on (i.e., credit to) residents, because of the direct impact of residents’ borrowing on \\ndomestic economic activity. Cred it flows between FCs are often excluded from broad credit \\nmeasures, but credit received by FCs from abroad  is needed to assess credit conditions in the \\ndomestic economy, not least credit extended betw een FCs in a direct investment relationship. \\nSpecific Credit Measures \\n6.123.  The surveys of the FCs sector presented in  Chapter 7 provide data on credit extended by \\nFCs to other domestic sectors. The surveys pr ovide aggregate measures  of credit, covering \\nclaims on the central government, state and lo cal government, public nonfinancial corporations, \\nother nonfinancial corporations, a nd households and NPISH. The sect oral balance sheets used to \\ncompile these surveys contain data that are used  to compile the broad domestic credit aggregate, \\nbroken down by sector of borrower, type of fina ncial asset, and currenc y of denomination (into \\ndomestic and foreign). \\n6.124.  In addition to those set out above, credit measures that can be important for the \\nformulation and implementation of monetary and other macroeconomic  policies include the \\nfollowing: \\n(a) \\nCentral bank credit . Extension of credit by the central bank to ODCs (and sometimes to \\nOFCs) is important for implementing monetary  policy. Such credit may be extended to \\n(1) provide liquidity to fund ongoing operations of ODCs, (2) enable ODCs to respond to ', metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Money_supply.pdf', 'page': 34}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=' 36 \\n \\n \\n seasonal credit demand, (3) influence domestic financial conditions and the amount of \\nbroad money, or (4) provide emergency assist ance, including equity  participation. The \\ncentral bank can either place deposits in, or  extend loans to, FCs. Either method provides \\nODCs with funds to support e xpansion of credit, leading to growth of broad money. \\nCentral banks regulate the cost at which FCs acquire such funds and attach other terms \\nand conditions to the access to such credit , thereby influencing credit and monetary \\nconditions in the economy. \\n(b) Central government credit . Central governments supply credit to FCs by extending loans \\nor by providing deposits that are intended to be used for credit extension by FCs. \\nGovernments also provide credit to nonfinancial sectors to fo ster public policy goals such \\nas development of specific industries or regi ons or to provide emergency aid. Credit from \\ngovernment units is often extended at subsid ized (i.e., below-market) interest rates. \\nComprehensive measures of government credit include lending by the central government and other levels of government. \\n6.125.

In BPM6 (paragraph 5.31), debt instruments are defined as those instruments that \\nrequire the payment of principal and/or in terest at some point(s) in the future.  All debt \\ninstruments are liabilities, but some liabilities are not debt. The definition of  debt is such that it \\nincludes all liabilitie s recognized in this Manual  and in other major st atistical manuals—except \\nfor equity and investment fund shares, and fi nancial derivatives and employee stock options \\n(ESOs). These liabilities, known as debt liabilities , comprise the following debt instruments: \\nspecial drawing right (SDR) allocations; curr ency and deposits (including unallocated gold \\naccounts); debt securities; loans; insurance, pens ion, and standardized gu arantee schemes; other \\naccounts payable, including trade cr edit and advances. It is useful in all cases to clearly identify \\nthe instruments included as sometimes debt aggr egates are presented excluding some types of \\ndebt instruments.\\n29  \\n6.128.  The surveys presented in Chapter 7 provide  a comprehensive framework for compiling \\nmeasures of debt owed to the FCs sector, as well as the debt of FC s to other sectors. Debt of the \\ntotal economy may be presented as  an aggregation of the debt of all domestic sectors, or on a \\nconsolidated basis that eliminates all debts that  are assets of residents, thereby leaving only \\nliabilities to nonresidents . The latter is referred to as external debt. \\n6.129.  Debt is an important element of any economy and can have significant impact, both \\npositive and negative, on all resident sectors and on economic growth. On the positive side, \\nborrowing allows funds to be channeled from sector s that are savers to th ose that need short or \\nlonger-term financing, through the FCs sector or  directly. From the bo rrowers’ perspective, \\ndepending on their economic function, debt provid es opportunities such as financing capital \\ninvestments, smoothing out expens es, and using future income fo r current needs. For example, \\nfor FCs, debt provides the necessary funding for expansion of financial intermediation (leveraging), nonfinancial corporations often use borrowing to finance their production and \\ncapital formation, government units borrow to finan ce expenses as well as  capital investments, \\nand households use debt to fina nce their current consumption, a sset purchases, and production. \\n6.130.  On the negative side, borrowing entails cost —in the form of interest payments—and an \\nobligation to repay. Therefore, debt  gives rise to future payment liabilities. As a consequence, \\nhigh levels of debt liabilities have the potenti al to create circumstances that render an \\ninstitutional unit, a sector, and even the whole economy vulnerable to li quidity (including debt \\nrollovers) and solvency risks. For these reasons, there is strong analytical interest in debt \\nmeasures. \\n6.131.  A key element in debt analysis is maturity structure. For maturity  analysis, debt data \\nshould be disaggregated, at a minimum, into shor t- and long-term categories, and more detailed \\nmaturity breakdowns are often useful. Data can be compiled on, either an original or, more \\n                                                \\n \\n29 If currency issued is covered in a debt aggregate, it is recommended to show it as a separate item, so that users \\nmay include or exclude it from the aggregate as they desire.

Features such as the ability to “call” the debt early \\nmay need to be identified in analyzing the maturity of some debt instruments. \\n6.132.  Countries compile a wide range of debt  measures, covering specific sectors and \\nsubsectors or an entire economy. In many cases, there are credit measur es that correspond to \\nspecific types of debt (e.g., cons umer credit and consumer debt). Some of the more common debt \\nmeasures are described below. \\nHousehold Debt \\n6.133.  Household debt is incurred for a variety of pur poses. Often debt is incurred to finance the \\npurchase of specific assets, such as real estate and automobiles which are pledged as collateral \\nfor loans. Households also incur debt to fi nance current consumpti on, education or medical \\nexpenses, for obtaining working capital or longe r-term funds for proprietorships, and for funding \\nthe purchase of equity or other financial assets. Interest rates, the size of monthly payments for \\ninstallment loans, expectations regarding future income, and wealth are all factors which affect \\nhouseholds’ decisions to borrow. \\n6.134.  Debt of the household sector is ofte n disaggregated into mortgage debt  and consumer \\ndebt, the latter term referring to many other types of household debt including the following: \\n(a) Loans that ODCs and OFCs (e.g., finance companie s) provide directly to their clients for \\ngeneral funding (personal loans) or for specific expenses (consumers loans). \\n(b) Trade credit with repayment by installmen ts provided by the sellers of goods and \\nservices. \\n(c) Credit card debt. \\n(d) Loans that are provided by insurance corpor ations and are collateralized by the \\nborrowers’ equity in such entities. \\n(e) Financial leases that permit consumers to us e and, possibly, eventually acquire durables \\nthrough such arrangements in lieu of conventional loan contracts. \\n6.135.  Because of the difficulty of obtaining data directly from households, data on consumer \\ndebt are usually derived from creditor sources.  \\nBusiness Debt \\n6.136.  Corporations and other business entities in cur short-term debt to finance current \\nproduction, acquire inventories, a nd meet recurring expenses such as tax and interest payments. \\nThey also acquire long-term debt to finance cap ital formation. Corporations may finance these \\nactivities by obtaining trade cred it, by borrowing from FCs, a nd by issuing debt securities. \\nPublic Sector Debt \\n6.137.  Data should be compiled for the central gove rnment, general government, and the entire \\npublic sector. Data on government debt are ofte n disaggregated by debt to residents and to ', metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Money_supply.pdf', 'page': 37}),\n",

Supplementary data on debt that is incurred by othe r sectors, but is guaranteed by \\nthe government, should be compiled if the am ounts of such guarantees are significant. \\n6.138.  The IMF’s Government Finance Statis tics Manual (2014)  provides international \\nguidelines for the construction of measures of go vernment debt. The Inter-Agency Task Force on \\nFinance Statistics (TTFS)—comprising representa tives of certain international organizations, \\nincluding the IMF—ha s published the first Public Sector Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers \\nand Users (2011), which focuses on improving the quality  and timeliness of these statistics and \\npromoting a convergence of recording practices. Th e government’s financial balance sheet is an \\nintegral part of fiscal risk a nd sustainability analysis. Financia l balance sheet data should cover \\nthe general government and incl ude memorandum information on contingent liabilities and \\narrears, if significant. \\nExternal Debt \\n6.139.  External debt refers to debt liabilities of  a country, sector, or unit to nonresidents. \\nExternal debt statistics, including debt service payments, are used in the analysis of vulnerability \\nto solvency and/or liquidity pr oblems. They are useful for gene ral macroeconomic analysis and \\nfor negotiations of debt rescheduling. \\n6.140.  The International Investment Positi on (IIP) statement described in the BPM6  covers an \\neconomy’s stock positions of extern al financial assets and liabiliti es. The IIP components can be \\nfully reconciled with the financial asset categories of the 2008 SNA . \\n6.141.  Analysis of the vulnerability of an economy’s external debt position requires data beyond \\nthat provided by the IIP framework. These othe r data series include information on the \\n(1) amount actually owed—the nominal value of debt , as opposed to the mark et value of external \\ndebt; (2) debt service schedule; (3) domestic a nd foreign currency composition of debt, needed to \\nascertain the possible balance-sheet effects arising from exchange  rate changes; and \\n(4) increasingly, extent to which financial deri vatives are used to hedge, or even increase, \\nexposure to risk. \\n6.142.  The TTFS has published the External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users \\n(2013), which provides international methodological standards for the measurement of external \\ndebt, as well as guidance on the analytical use of the data and on the sources and methods for \\ntheir compilation.

In a currency union, the union wide currency is  issued by a supranational central bank \\nsuch as the European Central Bank (ECB), Ea st Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), and the two \\ncentral banks of the CFA franc areas—Banque centrale des États de l’Afrique de l’Ouest \\n(BCEAO) and Banque des États de l’Afrique centr ale (BEAC). The union-wide currency serves \\nas the medium of exchange and domestic unit of a ccount in each of the member countries of the \\nunion. Several actions apply to each country in the currency union at its inception: \\n(a) For the transition to the union currency, a fixed exchange rate between the domestic \\ncurrency and the union currency is announced. \\n(b) Domestic currency banknotes and coins are wi thdrawn from circulation, either gradually \\nor within a preannounced period. \\n(c) The financial records of institutional units in all sectors of the economy are translated into \\nunion currency units which is the new standard unit of account.  \\n(d) Banknotes and coins denominated in the union currency are placed in circulation by the \\ncentral banks of the union’s member countries. \\n6.144.    The introduction of the union currency in an economy is reflected in the sectoral balance \\nsheets and surveys of the FCs of each union member country. \\n(a) Currency in circulation . This liability account of the central bank shows the amount of \\nunion-currency banknotes and coins issued by (or treated as if issued by ) the central \\nbank, as well as the amount of domestic cu rrency issued earlier by the central bank and \\nnot yet removed from circulation. \\n(b) Union currency banknotes and coins . Union currency banknotes a nd coins are classified \\nas in domestic currency.  \\n(c) Financial asset/liability disaggregation by currency . In the sectoral balance sheets/SRFs \\nin Appendix II, deposits are disaggreg ated into separate categories for domestic currency  \\nand foreign currency . For economies participating in a currency union, the common \\ncurrency is the domestic currency of all participant countries. \\nEstimation of currency-union currency  \\n6.145.  It is difficult to estimate the amount of  union currency in circ ulation in individual \\ncountries belonging to a currency union. The basic problem is the lack of data on cross-border \\ncurrency flows that do not appear in FCs’ accoun ts and generally are not  reported from other \\nsources to the monetary statistics compilers. \\n6.146.  Estimation and compilation practices for curre ncy in circulation differ across currency \\nunions. For the European Monetary Union, each national central bank records euro banknote liabilities in an amount equal to  its share of the total euro ba nknotes issued for the entire ', metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Money_supply.pdf', 'page': 39}),\n",

Each country’s share is calculated in proportion to the amount of its share in the \\nECB’s capital, with 8 percent of the issue allocated to the ECB; plus coins issued by the national \\ncentral bank intended for circulation. \\n6.147.  The ECCB has the exclusive right to issue the currency banknotes and coins of the \\nEastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU). The ECCU member countries do not have national \\ncentral banks, and the currency is  placed in circulation through the ODCs in these countries. The \\namount of currency issued in each member country is  based on each country’s equity share in the \\nECCU. All currency banknotes and coins are marked  with a specific letter to designate the \\ncountry where they were placed in circulation. Banknotes and coins spent in another member \\ncountry are eventually repatriated to the member country of issue. \\n6.148.  For countries which are members of BCEAO or BEAC, the currency banknotes issued by \\na member country are imprinted with an identif ying sign, which facilitates the repatriation of \\nbanknotes that circulate outsi de the country of issue.

Foreign currencies can serve two functions in  all countries other than the country of \\nissuance: \\n(a) Store of value . Foreign currency banknotes, and to a le sser extent coins, which are easily \\ntransported into and out of a country are held by all sectors of an economy. Holdings of \\ncurrency banknotes and coins issued by foreign countries constitute a separate category \\nof claims on nonresidents in the sectoral ba lance sheets of the FCs, and in the balance \\nsheets of institutional units in the nonfinancial sectors. \\n(b) Foreign unit of account . Institutional units in the va rious institutional sectors hold \\nforeign-currency-denominated assets—deposits , loans, debt securi ties, and financial \\nderivatives. DCs in many countries accept foreign currency-denominated deposits and \\nmake foreign currency-denominated loan s. Corporations and government units \\nsometimes issue foreign-currency-denominat ed debt securities and may have foreign \\ncurrency-denominated positions in financial derivatives and other accounts receivable/payable. \\n6.150.  Foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabi lities may be claims on and liabilities to \\nresidents or nonresidents. Foreign currency-de nominated deposits that DCs accept from money-\\nholding sectors that meet the definition of broad money are included in broad money. All foreign \\ncurrency-denominated claims on and liabilities to  nonresidents should be classified as foreign \\nassets and foreign liabilities, re spectively, regardless of the f unctions that foreign currencies \\nserve in the economy. \\n6.151.  Foreign currency serves additi onal functions in several count ries. In some countries, a \\nforeign currency is the only or principal medium of exchange,\\n30 and the foreign currency unit is \\nused as the domestic unit of account. These coun tries are referred to as  “dollarized” economies, \\nregardless of whether the U.S. dollar or some ot her foreign currency (such as the euro) is the \\nforeign currency that serves as the medium of exchange and the domestic unit of account.31 \\nDollarization has implications for the measuremen t of money aggregates in an economy and for \\nthe classification of financial a ssets and liabilities in the s ectoral balance sheets of FCs.32 \\n6.152.  Some countries use their own domestic uni t of account, but permit both domestic and \\nforeign currency to serve as media of excha nge. These countries are described as having \\ncurrency co-circulation. Currency co-circulation has im plications for the measurement of the \\n                                                 \\n30 The domestic currency in circulation in these countri es is limited to coins issued by the central bank or \\ngovernment and, in some countries, old domestic currency banknotes not yet removed from circulation. \\n31 The dollarization in Panama is a minor exception. The dome stic currency unit is the balboa, which is on a par with \\nthe U.S. dollar. The foreign currency unit (that is, U.S. dollar) is tantamount to being the domestic currency unit of \\nPanama. Coins denominated in balboa (but not balboa banknotes) are in circulation.  \\n32 This Manual  uses a narrower definition of dollarization than litera ture in which dollarized refers to any country in \\nwhich foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities are prevalent, even when domestic currency is the \\nmedium of exchange and unit of account.  By that definition, most countries  would be classified as dollarized. ', metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Money_supply.pdf', 'page': 41}),\n",

During the transition to a dollarized ec onomy, the following actions are taken: \\n(a) The financial records of institutional units in all sectors of the economy are converted \\nfrom the domestic unit of account to U.S. dollars (or other foreign unit of account) at an exchange rate announced by the central bank or government. \\n(b) Domestic currency banknotes are withdrawn from  circulation, either gradually or within a \\npreannounced period in which currency holders  are entitled to exchange the domestic \\ncurrency for U.S. dollars (or another fore ign currency) at the preannounced exchange \\nrate. \\n6.154.  Dollarization of an economy is reflected in the following accounts in the sectoral balance \\nsheets and surveys of the FCs: \\n(a) Currency in circulation\\n. After dollarization is  completed, this liabi lity account of the \\ncentral bank shows only the amount of dome stic currency-denominated coins and old \\ndomestic currency banknotes, if any,  that are still in circulation. \\n(b) Dollarization currency banknotes and coins . Holdings of the “dolla rization currency” are \\nincluded in the same category as holdings of other foreign currencies and along with \\nother foreign currencies are classified as claims on nonresidents (foreign assets). \\n(c) Financial asset/liability disaggreg ation by currency of denomination . In the sectoral \\nbalance sheets in Appendix II, all domestic positions in dollarization currency are  \\nincluded under domestic currency category. Po sitions in dollarization currency with \\nnonresidents are included under foreign currency. This di stinction for a dollarized \\neconomy is important for adherence to the defi nition of official international reserves \\nwhich includes only foreign-currency  assets.33 \\nCo-circulation \\n6.155.  In some countries, foreign currency is allo wed to co-circulate with domestic currency. \\nThe foreign currency serves as a medium of ex change and store of value, and the domestic \\ncurrency continues to serve as a medium of exchange, store of value, and the domestic unit of \\naccount. The circulation of foreign currency (oft en the currency of a ma jor trading partner) \\ntogether with circulation of do mestic currency is common in regional monetary integrations in \\nwhich member countries retain their domestic currencies. The currenci es are allowed to co-\\ncirculate freely within a single economy wher ein each currency serves as the medium of \\nexchange, and the domestic currency remains th e domestic unit of account. Co-circulation may \\nbe legally sanctioned, or may be permitted as an in formal practice that is clearly acceptable to \\n                                                 \\n33 On reserve assets as foreign currency assets , see BPM6 , paragraph 6.64.

Co-circulation of foreign currency does not a ffect the classification of the accounts in the \\nsectoral balance sheets of the FC s or in the balance sheets of th e other institutional units in the \\neconomy. The characteristics of curr ency in these countries are: \\n(a) Unit of account . The financial records in all sectors of the economy continue to be based \\non the domestic currency as the standard unit of account. \\n(b) Currency in circulation . The central bank’s account for cu rrency in circulation shows its \\nliability for the outstanding amount  of domestic currency that it has issued. Liabilities for \\nthe co-circulating foreign currency appear only in the records of the foreign central bank \\nor central government that issued the currency. \\n(c) Co-circulating banknotes and coins . Holdings of the co-circulating foreign currency \\ncontinue to be included in the same categ ory as holdings of othe r foreign currencies, \\nwherein all foreign currency is classified as  claims on nonresidents (foreign assets). \\n(d) Financial asset/liability disaggreg ation by currency of denomination . All financial assets \\nand liabilities denominated in a foreign curre ncy (whether or not a co-circulating foreign \\ncurrency) are classified as In foreign currency . \\n6.157.  Currency co-circulation may be combined w ith dollarization, as in the case of the \\nmonetary integration arrangement  of the Common Market Area (CMA) in southern Africa. The \\nrand is the domestic currency of  South Africa, as well as a co-c irculating currency in the other \\nCMA countries—Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland. Each of these countries has a domestic \\ncurrency that, along with rand note a nd coins, serves as a medium of exchange and the domestic \\nunit of account. Moreover, the domestic currencies  (Lesotho loti, Namibia dollar, and Swaziland \\nlilageni) have exchange rates that are pegged to the South African rand which makes the rand \\nakin to a domestic unit of acc ount. Under the monetary arrange ments, all CMA members share \\nthe seigniorage that South Africa obtains from  the issuance of rand banknotes and coins. \\nEstimation of dollarization and co-circulation currency \\n6.158.  Various techniques can be used to estimate th e amount of foreign currency in circulation \\nin dollarized economies and countries in which cu rrency co-circulation is extensive. Estimation \\nmethods can be based on surveys of currency ho ldings, historical information about currency \\nholdings, and econometric techniques. Similar tec hniques apply to the es timation of domestic \\ncurrency outflows from countries that provide the dollarization or co-c irculation currency to \\nother countries.35 \\n                                                 \\n34 Co-circulation is distinguished from ‘black market’ trading, which involves the buying and selling of foreign \\ncurrency in violation of national laws or regulations that are enforced. \\n35 Although several countries have shown considerable intere st in adjusting their money aggregates for circulation of \\nforeign currency, the implementation of such adjustments has not followed.

Collection of survey data on currency flows acr oss the domestic border is a first step in \\nestimating the currency in circul ation in a country with  co-circulation of cu rrency or a dollarized \\neconomy. Surveys typically cover currency trans actions within the banking system, or are \\ncustoms-type reports of currency carried by traveler s. In some countries, st atistical estimates of \\ninternational flows of currency are construc ted through netting of outflows and inflows \\nassociated with balance of payments transac tions. Gross outflows asso ciated with tourism, \\nemigrant remittances, and other activities are ne tted against gross inflows from tourism, bank \\nflows, etc. Some countries have formal customs reports that require repo rting of currency taken \\nacross borders. In some countries, data for sm all transactions need not be reported, or are \\nsampled. \\n6.160.  Data on currency shipments are important for estimating the cross-border currency flows. \\nWholesale shipments of U.S. curre ncy are provided by a few large FCs that specialize in this \\nservice. Local financial institutions acquire or re patriate U.S. dollars through wholesale shippers. \\nFor large shipments of U.S. currency, the U.S. Customs Department requires that a currency and \\nmonetary instrument report (CMIR) be filed by the shipper. The reporting applies only to cross-\\nborder currency shipments of $10,000 or more. \\n6.161.  Survey methods can be used to estimate foreign currency holdi ngs of the general \\npopulation of a country. In addition to amounts of U.S. dollars, euros, and other foreign \\ncurrencies held, the survey questions can delv e into motives for fo reign currency holding, \\nidentification of currency exchanges frequent ed by respondents, and their propensities for \\noverseas travel. A general aversion to disclosure of personal or confidential information about \\ncurrency transactions and holdings undermines the reliability of data fr om direct surveys of \\nhouseholds or businesses.36 \\n6.162.  A technique for accurate responses is to su rvey households only about their foreign \\ncurrency holdings relative to their domestic currency holdings. Using survey responses, the ratio \\nof foreign currency holdings to domestic currency  holdings and an estimate of households’ total \\ndomestic currency holdings, th e foreign currency holdings of  households can be estimated. \\n6.163.  Some insight into currency circulation may be gained by analyzing data on domestic \\ncurrency holdings37 before the introduction of  dollarization or before widespread use of co-\\ncirculation. Care must be exercise d in extrapolating from historic al experience. Data on currency \\nholdings in the period just prior to dollarization may reflect a fli ght to currency in response to \\nfinancial and economic instability  in the country which may have provided impetus for the move \\nto dollarization. For a country experiencing an evolution from cash-based to deposit-based \\ntransactions in the retail market, the propens ity for currency holding in periods before \\ndollarization or significant co-cir culation may contain information that is not relevant to the \\npresent period. \\n                                                 \\n36 A significant share of the currency circulation is associated with “n on-observed economy,” which includes \\nsmuggling and the use of cash transactions to avoid the recording of taxable income. Exclusion of participants in these activities would distort the coverage of the survey; inclusion would likely not lead to satisfactory results. \\n37 The total amount or as a proportion of a broad or narrow money aggregate.

The following terminology applies: \\n(a) Reservable liabilities . The categories of depos its and, if applicable, debt securities that \\nare subject to reserve requirements.  \\n(b) Reserve-computation period . The period over which reservable liabilities are averaged to \\ndetermine the reservable liab ility amounts to which the reserve requirements (in percent) \\nare applied. Alternatively, the co mputations may be based on re servable liabilities as of a \\nsingle date—for example, end-of-month levels. \\n(c) Reserve-maintenance period . The period over which the specified average amount of \\nrequired reserves is to be held. In some c ountries, large ODCs have reserve-maintenance \\nand reserve-computation periods that ar e different from those for small ODCs. \\n(d) Required reserves . ODC deposit holdings in the central bank39 (reserves deposits) that are \\nused to satisfy reserve requirements (see Chapter 4, paragraph 4.50). In many countries, \\nODC holdings of domestic currency in vault also qualify as required reserves. In a few \\ncountries, foreign currency deposit holdings in  the central bank also qualify as required \\nreserves. Required reserves are average hol dings during a reserve maintenance period.40 \\nThe reserve holdings may be intere st-bearing or non-interest-bearing. \\n(e) Lagged reserve requirements . Required reserve holdings in the reserve-maintenance \\nperiod are based on the average levels of rese rvable liabilities in a reserve-computation \\nperiod that precedes the maintenance period.41 The reserve-computation period may \\nimmediately precede the maintenance period, or may precede the maintenance period by \\none or more weeks or months.  \\n(f) Reserve settlement . The accounting for required reserv es at the end of the reserve-\\nmaintenance period.

Seasonal adjustment of economic time series  involves the estimation and removal of \\nfluctuations that recur each y ear with a broadly similar patter n. They may be linked to public \\nholidays,44 harvest seasons or other production cycles, model-year changeovers, administrative \\nand legal measures, etc. Seasonal adjustment can be based on mathematical (deterministic) \\nmodels, econometric (stochastic, or statistica l) models, or both. Procedures that combine \\nmathematical and econometric techniques are now widely used. \\n6.170.  Many countries seasonally adjust price st atistics, GDP and ot her national accounts \\nstatistics, exports/imports and other balance of  payments statistics, monetary and financial \\nstatistics, and other macroeconomic time series. S easonal adjustment is usef ul for analyzing short \\nterm developments and is applied to both monthly and quarterly data.45 \\n6.171.  Seasonal adjustment of money aggregates and, to  a lesser extent, credit  aggregates are the \\nmost common applications of seasonal adjustment  in monetary and financial statistics. This \\nannex describes the general ap plication of seasonal adjustme nt methods with emphasis on \\nseasonal adjustment of monthly money aggregat es. Quarterly monetary data may also be \\nseasonally adjusted, but seasonally adjusted monthl y data are viewed as the most relevant for \\nanalytical and policy purposes in most countries. General principles discussed in this annex also \\napply to series for other economic variables. \\nDirect and indirect seasonal adjustment  \\n6.172.  Economic time series—in particular money a ggregates derived from multiple balance \\nsheet items—consist of additive component series. In the case of univariate (single series) \\nseasonal adjustment, aggregate time series and thei r components can be adjusted either directly \\nor indirectly. The direct seasonal adjustment of a series is obtained by applying the chosen \\nadjustment method to the origin al unadjusted time series. The indirect seasonal adjustment  of a \\nseries is obtained as a linear combination of  other seasonally adjusted  component series or \\nrelated aggregates.  \\n6.173.  From a cost viewpoint, the level of data disa ggregation for which seasonal adjustment is \\ncalculated in general in creases the amount of resources ne eded to maintain the seasonal \\nadjustment of the monetary statistics. In other words, from a cost standpoint, direct seasonal \\nadjustment of main aggregates may be preferab le as the procedure is only performed on a few \\nseries.  \\n6.174.  This Manual  recommends that , if a choice between approaches  is necessary, the analyst \\nresponsible for the seasonal adjustment concen trate on a thorough application of the direct \\n                                                 \\n44 Holidays such as Christmas or New Year occur on a fixe d day and month of each year; the dates of holidays such \\nas Chinese New Year, Easter, Ramadan, and Deepavali move from year to year. Seasonal adjustment methods can accommodate both fixed and moving holiday season. \\n45 Seasonal adjustment has also been applied to weekly and daily data, but with limited success.

Seasonal adjustment is a non-linear operation on the data and, as such, it is not additive. \\nTherefore, if the seasonally adjusted presentation of the data includes separate time series for an \\naggregate and its components, a choice must be ma de as to which series  in the balance sheet \\nidentity need to be adjusted direct ly or indirectly (i.e. as a linear combination of other series), in \\norder to preserve the additivity. \\n6.176.  Application of indirect seas onal adjustment can take va rious forms, depending on the \\nway in which the components of the aggregate ar e defined and on their time series behavior over \\ntime. In particular, the main choice is whether to  (1) directly adjust a ll the components and then \\nindirectly derive the aggregate as sum, or (2) di rectly adjust the aggregate time series and some \\ncomponents, leaving one component as a residual. For instance, an application of the former to \\nthe components of broad money would specify A = M1 (that is, currency plus transferable \\ndeposits); B = M2  less M1; and C = Broad Money less M2. Components A, B, and C each would \\nbe directly seasonally adjuste d, and then would be summed to  obtain the seasonally adjusted \\nseries for broad money. On the other hand, a si mplified application of the second approach \\nwould be the seasonal adjustment  of deposits in broad money by institutional sector of the \\nholder. This would involve direc tly adjusting total deposits and all but one sect oral component, \\nwhich would be instead calculate s as a difference between the total and the directly adjusted \\ncomponents. \\n6.177.  An unambiguous decision rule for choosing be tween the direct and indirect methods of \\nseasonal adjustment does not exist. An important consideration is that th e indirectly adjusted \\nseries are calculated as a residual of the other identity components’ direct adjustment. In turn, \\nthis implies that a meaningful indirect seasonal  adjustment depends on the accuracy of the direct \\nadjustment of the related series. The choice must be made on a case-by-case basis, after \\nexperimentation with both methods. For a specifi c time series, several practical criteria have \\nbeen recommended. These include: (1) “smoothne ss” of the seasonally adjusted series,46 \\n(2) minimization of revision erro rs, (3) stability of seasonal co mponents and (4) out-of-sample \\nforecasting accuracy. Informal “rules of thumb” are: (1) the direct adjustment approach has \\nadvantages when the components of the aggregat e time series are highly correlated, (2) the \\nindirect approach has advantages with respect to minimization of estimation and revision errors \\nwhen the components have dissim ilar stochastic (statistical) pr operties and (3) the indirect \\napproach has advantages when the contribution of each component, as a proportion of the aggregate, fluctuates signifi cantly over the estimation period.\\n47 \\n6.178.  A different approach to seasonal adjust ment of aggregates and components is the \\nmultivariate seasonal adjustment . In this approach, the compone nts of the aggregate and, in \\nsome cases, other related economic time series, ar e adjusted simultaneously. Application of this \\n                                                 \\n46 The smoothness criterion is specified in terms of “rough ness measures” computed for seasonally adjusted series \\nobtained by each approach. The criterion does not imply that seasonal adjustment is aimed at smoothing a time \\nseries, but seasonal adjustment generally leads to  a time series with less seasonal variability. \\n47 For more information, see European Central Bank (2000b), pp. 9–10.

The multivariate approach is not advocated in this Manual , because of its computational \\ncomplexity and software limitations. The most widely used software packages for seasonal \\nadjustment, described later in this section, are designed exclusively for univariate (single-series) \\nseasonal adjustment. Major advantages of thes e seasonal adjustment pr ograms include ease of \\nuse, diversity of modeling specifications, and breadth of advanced statistical tools for \\nspecification of the seasonal adjustment mode l, estimation of the seasonal components, and \\ndiagnostic testing of th e time-series output. \\nSeasonal adjustment software packages  \\n6.180.  The most popular seasonal adjustment packag es, extensively applied worldwide, are the \\nX-12-ARIMA48 program of the U.S. Census Bureau and the combination of the TRAMO \\n(“Time-series Regression with ARIMA Noise, Missing Observations and Outliers”) and SEATS \\n(“Signal Extraction in ARIMA Time Series”) programs developed at the Bank of Spain.49  \\n6.181.  The ARIMA module (called RegARIMA) in  X-12-ARIMA and the TRAMO part of \\nTRAMO/SEATS are similar in that both use ti me-series regression models to forecast (and \\n“backcast”) input data and to detect and correct for outlier s, calendar effects, missing \\nobservations, etc. The decomposition modules (called X-11) in X-12-ARIMA and SEATS are \\nused to separately identify a nd estimate the trend-cycle, season al, and irregular components of a \\ntime series, but using different methods. The X-12-ARIMA method uses an existing set of \\nmoving-average filters, whereas the SEATS method uses ARIMA- based signal extraction with \\nfilters derived from the ARIMA-type modeling. \\n6.182.  The X-12-ARIMA program—still the most widely applied worldwide—is used by the \\nIMF to seasonally adjust the monthly data for Money  and Broad Money  in the IFS country pages. \\nApplication of X-12-ARIMA require s a time series that has a sufficient number of observations. \\nAs of end-2013, the requirements have been satisf ied for nearly all countries, and data for the \\nMoney, Seasonally Adjusted and Broad Money, Seasonally Adjusted  in most IFS country pages \\nhave been based on X-12-ARIMA techniques.50 Money, Seasonally Adjusted  refers to the money \\nsupply as narrowly defined.  \\n                                                 \\n48 Bureau of the Census (1999).  \\n49 For further details, see Gòmez and Maravall (1996).  \\n50 The IMF employs the automatic options in the X12-ARIMA program, because of the magnitude of the task and \\nthe need to present data for which the seasonal adjustment  is consistent across countries. Detailed examination of \\nseasonality in the money series for each countryis not feas ible.

The \\nRegARIMA model is used to prepare the data input to the X-11 module in which the \\ndecomposition of the time series into trend/ cycle, seasonal, and irregular components is \\nperformed. An important function of the regARIMA  modeling is to extend the time series with \\npre-series estimates (backcasts) a nd post-series forecasts to improve  the estimates of the seasonal \\nadjustments to the earliest and most recent data in order to enable the use of symmetric moving-\\naverage processes in a decomposition of  the time series at its extremes. \\n6.184.  A third stage of the seasonal ad justment process is statistica l analysis of the data output \\nof the X-11 module, including the seasonally adjusted  time series. The analysis utilizes standard \\nstatistical tests and examination of out-of-sample forecasts of the seasonally adjusted data. The \\nseasonal adjustment procedure may need to be an  iterative process in which the RegARIMA and \\nX-11 decomposition are repeated until the post- X-11 analysis indicate s that the seasonal \\nadjustment is satisfactory.51 \\n6.185.  The post-estimation analysis subsumes the po licies and procedures for revision of the \\nseasonally adjusted data. Standard practice is to reestimate the seasonal factors when additional time-series observations become available. Re-es timation and revision of the seasonally adjusted \\ndata can be performed on an annual basis or more  or less frequently. The data revision policy—\\nan important component of the seasonal adjust ment framework—may call for several revisions \\nof the seasonally adjusted time series, leading up to  the seasonally adjusted series in final form. \\n6.186.  The X-12-ARIMA and TRAMO/SEATS programs have statistical properties that are \\nworthy of combining. This has prompted the development of the X-13-ARIMA-SEATS program, which is now in use at the US Bureau of the Census.\\n52 In particular, the new approach \\ndiffers from X-12-ARIMA in that the second stag e of the algorithm may now use either the X-11 \\nmodule or the SEATS method. A dditionally, X-13-ARIMA-SEATS provides the analyst with a \\ncomparison of the seasonal patterns identified us ing the two different methods. The possibility to \\nchoose between X-11 and SEATS in general allows for smoother results, as the two methods \\nperform differently depending on the series being analyzed. \\n                                                 \\n51 Residual seasonality sometimes is found in the adjusted data, leading to further empirical work.  \\n52 Due to its prevalent use among institutions (including the IMF), this annex discusses the most prominent features \\nof X12-ARIMA.

A model \\nspecification might include many parameters, when a simpler specification with fewer \\nparameters would have been adequate. Such over-specification can lead  to unnecessarily poor \\nestimation of the time series. For example, sp ecification of a moving-av erage process with a \\nsingle parameter may substitute for an autoregressive process that has many parameters, or vice versa.\\n54 \\n6.190.  Estimation  of the parameters of the RegARIMA model is performed by the X-12-\\nARIMA routine for maximum likelihood estimation us ing an iterative generalized least-squares \\nalgorithm. \\n6.191.  Diagnostic checking  involves analysis of the residuals from the fitted model to explore \\nthe possibility of model inadequacies. X-12- ARIMA produces several standard residual \\ndiagnostics for detecting additive  outliers and level shifts in th e data. The program also produces \\nforecasts, forecast standard errors, and predic tion intervals from the fitted regARIMA model. \\nDecomposition of an economic time series \\n6.192.  For seasonal adjustment purposes, a time se ries is decomposed into three major \\ncomponents:  \\n(a) Trend-cycle component  (Tt): constitutes the underlying path or  general direction reflected \\nin the data, combining the long-term trend and business-cycle movements. \\n(b) Seasonal component  )(c\\ntS: comprises  seasonal effects narrowly defined  (St) and \\ncalendar-related systemic effects that are not st able in timing from year to year, including \\ntrading-day and end-of-month effects (TD t), moving-events effects  (ME t), and other \\ncalendar effects (OC t). In the case of flow variables, trading-day effect s arise from year-\\nto-year variations in the number of work days (tra ding days) and the weekday \\ncomposition for a particular month or quarter relative to the standard for a particular \\nmonth or quarter. In the case of stock variables, end-of-period calendar effects arise from \\nobserving the level of th e variable on a specific day of th e week (e.g., measuring currency \\nin circulation on a Friday may lead to a hi gher than average value, due to cash hoarding \\nfor weekend expenditure). Moving-events effects  arise from occasions such as moving \\nholidays, paydays for large groups of employ ees, and pension payments that occur at \\nregular intervals but not at exactly the same time each year. The other calendar effects  \\ninclude leap-year and length-of -quarter effects.

From an analytical \\nperspective, the irregular component cont ains economically significant information on \\nshort-term developments. \\n6.193.  The seasonal adjustment decomposition can be  specified in additive or multiplicative \\nform. The default option in the X-12-ARIMA progr am is the multiplicative form, because that \\nspecification has proved to be supe rior for a wide variety of economic time series. For monetary \\nstatistics, this result is linked to the fact that most balance sh eet series have an exponential long-\\nrun trend. In the multiplicative spec ification, the absolute size of the components of the series are \\ndependent on each other, resulting in seasonal varia tions that increase and decrease with the level \\nof the series. The seasonal and irregular co mponents of the multiplicative model are ratios \\ncentered on a value of 1. \\nSeasonal adjustment revision policy \\n6.194.  Seasonal adjustment analysis is not completed when the first set of data for the seasonally \\nadjusted time series has been produced. Seasonall y adjusted data for a time series can be \\nimproved by using the additional observations for the time series, as the data become available. \\nSeasonally adjusted data for money aggregates an d other economic series may be revised several \\ntimes before the latest revised data are deemed to be final. A general rule is that the seasonal \\nadjustment is repeated until the revisions in the seasonal factors from successive re-estimations \\nare small. Ideally, the concept of small revisions  can be quantified and, where possible, revision \\nstatistics can be applied.56 \\n6.195.  Determination of the periodicity of the revisions in seasonally adjusted series is left to the \\nauthorities.

An FC that has issued debt securities is unlik ely to be able to easily identify the holders, \\nand may be unable to disaggregate debt securities liabilities by  holding institutional sector, as \\nprescribed by this Manual .  \\n6.197.  Debt securities that are issued, and held excl usively within the FCs sector do not create a \\nsectoring problem for the monetary and financial statistics. For example, central banks may issue \\ndebt securities for which ODCs are the only elig ible purchasers, in which case the institutional \\nsector of the holders is given.  In an unlikely case FCs—the ce ntral bank, ODCs, or OFCs—may \\nissue debt securities that can be  held and traded exclusively am ong FCs. Suppose debt securities \\nissued by ODCs can be held and traded only among FCs. Because of secondary market trading in \\nthe securities, the ODC does not have the info rmation required for the disaggregation by holding \\nsector—that is, into separate categories for centr al bank, ODCs, and OFCs. The compilers of the \\nmonetary and financial statistics receive data, by institutional sect or of holder, in the form of \\nFCs’ reporting on their debt s ecurities holdings, which are disa ggregated by issuing sector \\n(including separate categories fo r the central bank, ODCs, and OF Cs). Using these data provided \\nto the compilers, the debt security  liabilities of the ODC subsector ( but not those of an individual \\nODC) can be disaggregated by holding FC subsector.57 \\n6.198.  Sectoral disaggregation is mo re complicated when the debt  securities issued by FCs are \\nheld by several domestic sectors and, in some cases, nonresidents. In so me countries, security \\nownership surveys are conducted for use in disagg regating the securities data for the monetary \\nand financial statistics. Surveys that focus on nonresident holdings of  securities (i.e., equity and \\ndebt instruments) are used to  obtain data for the balance of payments statistics in many \\ncountries.58 \\n6.199.  The broader recommendation in this Manual  is that, if no other information on current \\nholders is available, debt securities issued by al l institutional sectors are classified by sector of \\nthe original purchasers of the securities.

The description of broad money in the previ ous sections focuses on a measure of broad \\nmoney ( M) in which the money components ( mi, i = 1, 2,... n) are weighted linearly and equally in \\nthe final total: \\uf0e5\\n\\uf03d\\uf03dn\\niim M\\n1, wherein the components ( mi’s) are treated as perfect substitutes. As \\nsuch, broad money represents a measure of the stock of nominal monetary wealth that is a \\nmeasure of DCs monetary liabilit ies. As discussed in previous paragraphs, different components \\nof broad money have different degree of moneyness and the broad money aggregate does not \\nfully reflect that money components are not perfect,  but only close, substi tutes for each other. \\n6.202.  Divisia money  is a quantity index measuring the change of quantity of money between \\ntwo time periods by assigning different weights to the growth rates of money components—\\ncurrency, transferable deposits, other deposits , etc.—according to th e usefulness of each \\ncomponent for transactions purposes.61 The relative relevance of each component for making \\ntransactions is proxied by the user costs  (opportunity costs) of holding the various money \\ncomponents. A user cost  is measured by the spread between a benchmark rate—the interest rate \\npaid on a financial asset that cannot be used fo r making transactions in the short run—and the \\ninterest rate paid on a particular component of the money aggregate. \\n6.203.   By weighting the growth rates of money co mponents, the Divisia index takes account of \\nthe trade-off between their medium of exchange a nd store of value functions. It is assumed that \\nrelatively illiquid financial assets are less likely to be used for transactions purposes than highly \\nliquid assets included in the meas ure of money supply and that hi gher interest rates are paid on \\nthe less liquid assets. The largest weights tend to be attached to  components that are directly \\nusable as media of exchange (domestic cu rrency and non-interest -bearing transferable \\ndeposits).62 The smallest weights tend to be assign ed to those money co mponents that are not \\ndirectly usable as media of exchange and for whic h the interest rates are closest to the benchmark \\nrate. \\n6.204.  The general formula of the Divisi a index is shown in Box 6.9. \\n                                                 \\n61 The Divisia index was originated by the French economi st Francois Divisia (1925). On the development of the \\nDivisia index for money aggregates, see Barnett (1980); Barnett, Offenbacher, and Spindt (1984); Barnett, Fisher, \\nSerletis (1992), Anderson, Jones, and Nesmith (1997), Ba rnett and Serletis (2000), Bolongia and Binner (2000), \\nStracca (2001), Barnett and Chauve t (2011), and Ba rnett (2012).  \\n62 Boxes 6.9 and 6.10 show that the weights depend on the user costs of the components, but also on the relative \\namounts outstanding of the various money components.
